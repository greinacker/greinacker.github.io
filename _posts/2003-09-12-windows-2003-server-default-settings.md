[Dave Burke](http://weblogs.asp.net/dburke/posts/27349.aspx) isn't happy with Windows 2003 Server's default security settings:

> *\[...\] But at the end of the flying day or computing day, what has changed?  Really?  As a developer (or flyer), there is just more crap to do to get to where you want to go.  But at the end of the day you still end up at the same place.*

Windows 2000 was like buying a big new house, moving in, and seeing that all the doors and windows are unlocked and open. You have to remember to go around the house and close/lock them, assuming that you care if anyone breaks in.

Windows 2003 is a similar house, albeit with stronger doors and more tamper-resistant locks...but when you move in, all the doors and windows are locked - and you can open what you wish.

Seems like an easy choice to me.
