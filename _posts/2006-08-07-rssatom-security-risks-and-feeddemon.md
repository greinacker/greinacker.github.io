The blogosphere has been busy talking about the SPI Dynamics presentation at the Black Hat security event.  Some of the [articles](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/cnet/2006-08-04-rss-risk_x.htm) [following](http://news.com.com/2100-1002_3-6102171.html) the presentation have mentioned FeedDemon as a vulnerable application...this isn't actually true.

[Nick Bradbury goes into detail](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/08/feed_security_a.html) on his blog.

Bottom line - despite what's being reported in the press, current versions of FeedDemon are not vulnerable to any of the serious exploits they reported.
