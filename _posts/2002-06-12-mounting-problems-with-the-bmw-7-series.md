**The Right Car**

> *Mounting problems with the* [*BMW 7 Series*](http://detnews.com/2002/insiders/0206/11/d01-511572.htm)*. Maybe one day people will realize how overrated the Beemer really is. Nice car for the most part but definetly much to overhyped. Don't believe me? Just test drive a 330 and a* [*Infiniti G35*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0101986/stories/2002/04/30/testDrive2003InfinitiG35.html) *back to back. And then decide what to do with the \$10K that you can save with the Infiniti G35 \[*[*The Wagner Blog*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0101986/)*\]*

> *Right sentiment, wrong car. ;) I've had my Audi A6 2.7t for almost 2 years, and I've never driven a car that's even remotely like it, especially not for the price. Where \$40k might get you into a bottom level 3-Series, it buys you one of the fastest, most comfortable, and downright well appointed luxury cars on the road. The twin turbos show virtually no lag, even here at 6500 feet. Oh, and with fully-independent full-time all wheel drive, it handles like a snowmobile in the winter weather. :)  \[*[*The .NET Guy*](http://www.quality.nu/dotnetguy/)*\]*

I tried very hard to let this go, but being a die-hard car guy and race driver I just couldn't.  ;-)  I'm a BMW guy myself; don't have one any more, but I've missed them ever since I sold my 328.  There's a certain driving *feel* to most BMW's that has yet to be matched in any Audi that I have driven; balance and steering feedback is top-notch.  The closest to this was a friend's S4, but still not the same (although I must confess, I only drove the S4 twice).  But for the track, I'd take a BMW over either the Infiniti or an Audi.

Now when the snow falls, as you mention, it's a whole different story.  :-)
