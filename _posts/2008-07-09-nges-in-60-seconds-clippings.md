Onward, I say. Time for the next installment in the series, this one covering clippings.

There's a lot of buzz about clippings in [NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com) (and shared items in Google Reader), especially with apps like [ReadBurner](http://blogs.newsgator.com/daily/2008/06/share-your-clip.html) making them easy to discover. There are similar use cases for clippings in the enterprise.

[NewsGator Enterprise Server](http://www.newsgator.com/Business/EnterpriseServer/Default.aspx) supports two kinds of clippings - personal clippings, and group clippings (which are shared by a group). This video covers personal clippings; group clippings will be coming next time.

And don't forget you can download a [free 20-user version](http://www.newsgator.com/Business/EnterpriseServer/Default.aspx) of NewsGator Enterprise Server. :-)
