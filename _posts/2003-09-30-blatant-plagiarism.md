Go to the NewsGator Feed Search page at <http://www.newsgator.com/feeds.aspx>, and look at the right side where we list some places to find more feeds.

Now go to <http://www.feed-me.info/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=32>. Look familiar?

Not only is our text being used *word-for-word*, but two of the images (for Syndic8 and Daypop) are images that we made ourselves (with permission), since there wasn't anything else available. Too bad they're not linking to the images on my server - I could have some fun.

Update 10/1/2003 10:00am - it appears the page in question has been removed.
