Well, my 6-week (!) trial of the most excellent [Virtual PC](http://www.connectix.com/products/vpc5w.html) from Connectix has finally run out. This product has been instrumental in my everyday life since I first tried it, mostly for testing [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) on multiple OS's, configurations, and Outlook versions. I've got 5 or 6 images that I use regularly, and 5 or 6 more that I test on before shipping a release.

It's \$229 to purchase, which I don't have a problem with. My question is, is there anything cool in [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/products/desktop/ws_features.html) that I'm missing? VPC seems to be working fine, albeit hanging my machine every now and then. I could try out VMWare, but it's going to be a huge investment in time to build the images I need. So basically, VMWare is going to have to do something much better or faster than VPC for it to be worth it to spend the time to switch.

What kills me is this thing is probably going to ship in MSDN in a few months, so I will have paid for it twice. But on the other hand, I can't wait a couple of months. Heh.

Comments, anyone? Is VMWare cool enough to switch?
