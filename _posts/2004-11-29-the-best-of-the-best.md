Yep, we're still looking for great Windows and .NET developers.  Turns out it's pretty hard to find folks with the depth of knowledge we're looking for.  Most recently, [Gordon](http://www.eighty-twenty.net/blog) has joined us (welcome!), but we still need more help.

So I thought I might list a few questions that our ideal candidate wouldn't have too many problems with. Does this describe you?

- You know the difference between \_beginthreadex and CreateThread.
- You know all of the ways to share memory between Win32 processes.  (hint - it's a short list.) (another hint - it's a *really* short list.)
- You know what an AppDomain is, and you can think of a reason you might want to create one yourself.
- You know what a HttpModule is, and you can think of at least two examples of why you might use one.
- You know what Mutexes and Semaphores are used for. (hint - they don't magically enable sharing stuff between threads.)
- You know you can override member functions in C++ without them being declared virtual; and you know when and why you *should* declare them virtual.
- You can explain the difference between:  
     
     A::A() {m_x = 5;}  
     
  and  
     
     A::A() : m_x(5) { }  
   
- When someone asks you to write code on a whiteboard to reverse a string in place, you're disappointed that they didn't ask a more interesting question.
- You know that IL isn't interpreted.
- You can explain transaction isolation levels as they relate to SQL Server.
- You know what the Running Object Table is, and can think of situations when you might want to use it.
- You want to work with an amazing team of folks who thought I shouldn't have put such easy questions on my blog.
- If you're not already here, you're interested in relocating to Colorado.

Most of the work we do is in C#...however, some of our work is done in C++ (Managed C++ in most cases).

So if you want to come work with us, working on cutting-edge products for a very quickly growing company, then send a note to jobs (at) newsgator.com!
