After [lots](http://www.newsgator.com/forum/shwmessage.aspx?forumid=4&messageid=4426) [of](http://andrewconnell.com/blog/archive/2004/10/26/610.aspx?Pending=true) [complaints](http://blog.arvind-satya.com/archives/2004/10/newsgator_onlin_1.php) (and many, many more via email and other channels), we've changed the way the folder organization GUI works in [NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com). It's now easy to organize feeds into folders, and do it with multiple feeds at a time.

Thanks to everyone that has provided feedback on the new system - keep it coming! There have actually been lots of changes, getting loaded several times per week...so your feedback is definitely being heard and acted on, even if we don't publicly mention it. :-)
