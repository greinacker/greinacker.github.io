I'm usually not one to just post other people's stuff verbatim, but [this post](http://www.phoenixtrap.com/~mjg/index.php/2003_04_01_archive.xml#91791656) from [Mark Gardner](http://www.phoenixtrap.com/~mjg/) is just too cool for words:

> *Interesting* [*NewsGator*](http://www.newsgator.com/) *trick: Put all or most of your feeds into one Outlook folder, and give it a timeline view filtering out read items. What you get is a scrollable "space" containing a mixed variety of news items -- scroll left and right to move around in time, and up and down to view posts within that window of time.*

> *I find this helps me catch up on a variety of sites that I might otherwise miss from having to drill down to individual feeds, or having to scroll down through the entirety of a feed's updates just to get to the next one. When they're jumbled like this, yet still organized by time, I can quickly scan through looking for the latest interesting stuff.  *

> *Most other news aggregators I've tried don't have the flexibility of views that Outlook+NewsGator offers. It's true you could use a simple table view to get the now-ubiquitous* [*three-paned interface*](http://www.newsgator.com/ShowImage.aspx?url=ss_normal.gif)*, but that just doesn't cut it when you start subscribing to hundreds of feeds at a time.*

I love it when people show me ways to use NewsGator that I haven't seen before. Thanks Mark!
