Good news! Version 0.1 of the Outlook News Aggregator is now available for download. It requires Outlook 2002 (aka Outlook XP). If you run into any problems, please let me know. Thanks for your [interest](/gregr/weblog/2003/01/04/news-aggregator/)!

A big thanks to [Joe Gregorio](http://bitworking.org/) - the Outlook aggregator currently uses parts of the excellent [Aggie](http://bitworking.org/Aggie.html) as its RSS engine.

**UPDATE (1/15)**: the links in this post have been removed; my logs indicate version 0.1 is still being downloaded. As of today, the current version is 0.6 - you can find more information and download links at the [NewsGator site](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/).
