I'm very pleased to announce the release of [NewsGator 1.0](http://www.newsgator.com/)!

At the same time comes the public debut of NewsGator's new home, [http://www.newsgator.com](http://www.newsgator.com/). There you'll find lots of information about NewsGator, news, downloads, a RSS feed search system, support resources (including a knowledge base and discussion forums), and of course the NewsGator store.

This has been an interesting development cycle...all the way from the first concept screen shot right here on my weblog, to where we are today with version 1.0. I'd like to publicly thank all of those who have been working with the 0.x versions, and especially those folks who volunteered to thoroughly test the RC1 release. Thanks to all of your efforts, I think NewsGator 1.0 is a great product!

There are numerous changes since the last release. I encourage you to download version 1.0 and try it...and if you like it, spread the word!
