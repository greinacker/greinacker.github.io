About a week and a half ago, [TechStars](http://www.techstars.org/) launched. Basically, it's a startup "bootcamp" - 10 teams will get a small amount of seed funding, work in Boulder, CO getting their new companies off the ground, and be mentored by a [long list of smart folks](http://www.techstars.org/site/page/pg5883.html). It's the brainchild of [David Cohen](http://www.davidgcohen.com/blog/), and has some great people involved (including [Brad Feld](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/002136.html)). When David offered me a chance to participate, I jumped at the chance.

Michael Arrington wrote about it yesterday on [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/25/techstars-summer-camp-for-entrepreneurs), and likes the idea. But what blew me away was some of the negative [comments](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/25/techstars-summer-camp-for-entrepreneurs#comments) to his post. Most of the negatives seem to circle around the investment/equity part; basically, TechStars puts in \$5,000 per founder (up to \$15,000), and takes a 5% stake. Normally I'd write something clever now about the pre-money valuation of a napkin :-), but that really isn't the point.

The point is, being mentored through the summer by this group of people is SO worth it. When I started [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/), I didn't know anyone in the business, and really didn't know a lot of successful entrepreneurs (other than consultants), let alone people in the legal or investment communities. When I saw my first venture term sheet, it was such a shock I'm sure I had some interesting expletives for my attorney (who, incidentally, had to be recommended to be by the same Brad Feld who was doing the investment, because again, I didn't really know anyone in this community).

If I could go back to the beginning of NewsGator, would I have given up 5% equity for the kind of mentoring and contacts I would have made in a program like this? Yes - in a heartbeat. I can think of specific decisions I made on my own that I may have made differently if I had had a chance to talk to people like the folks on this list...and they could have made a positive impact on the company very early in its life.

Never underestimate the value of your network. And to those poo-pooing the whole concept, I'd remind you that there are a lot of people who don't live in Silicon Valley, who have never met a VC in their life, but who have great ideas that could turn into the next big thing.
