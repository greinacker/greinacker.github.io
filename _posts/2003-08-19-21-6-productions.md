Back in another life, at [Galileo](http://www.galileo.com), I worked with a guy named Justin Mette, probably one of the smartest developers I've had the pleasure to work with.

Well, a while back Justin left Galileo and formed a independent gaming studio called [21-6 Productions](http://www.21-6.com/news.asp)...and they've been doing some amazing stuff. At lunch a couple of weeks ago, I finally convinced him to create a [RSS feed](http://www.21-6.com/news-rss.asp) for their news so I could keep up with what they've been up to. And I see that a few days ago, they released version 2.1 of their award-winning game, [Orbz](http://www.21-6.com/orbz.asp) - looks like they've been busy. Head over and take a look!
