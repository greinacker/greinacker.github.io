Way back in 2005, NewsGator [acquired FeedDemon](/gregr/weblog/2005/05/17/newsgator-acquires-feeddemon/). I vividly remember sitting down with [Nick Bradbury](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/05/newsgator_acqui.html) and talking about our shared vision for the future of [FeedDemon](http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/feeddemon/default.aspx) and the [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) platform...and many a night drinking a lot of beer and talking about RSS and what we now call social computing. Through it all, Nick remained laser-focused on both the future of FeedDemon, and his customers and how they would be brought forward.

Along the way, we [added](/gregr/weblog/2005/10/04/newsgator-acquires-netnewswire/) [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswire/default.aspx) to the family, as well as [SmartFeed](/gregr/weblog/2006/03/14/newsgator-mobile-applications/) (renamed NewsGator Go! for Windows Mobile). All of it was part of building out the original vision for a core online content platform, and best-of-breed applications on nearly any device to consume content. All in all, I think we delivered on this vision - we built the platform, added the best applications on the most popular platforms, and made it all work together.

Since then, as you may have gathered, our enterprise business has grown faster than we anticipated (this is a good thing!). As the company has started to focus more and more on enterprise customers, we made the difficult decision to shut down NewsGator Online, and focus our online platform in on our commercial clients. As part of this transition, most of our client applications (FeedDemon, NetNewsWire, and NetNewsWire for iPhone) were re-released to sync with Google Reader as an online store, rather than NewsGator Online.

As part of that transition, Nick has gone "back into the wild" as an independent developer. FeedDemon remains a NewsGator product, but Nick is 100% focused on it, and he has complete control over the product direction and feature set. I like to think of this not as the end of anything, but rather the beginning of the next phase of FeedDemon's life. Just as the initial deal with NewsGator opened up new opportunities for it, so does this new direction...and FeedDemon customers will see lots of exciting things coming up.

On a personal note, I'd like to extend a big "thank you" to Nick, on behalf of myself and everyone at NewsGator. Nick has been instrumental in forming our consumer product direction, always makes sure we're taking care of our customers in the best way we can, and has provided a huge amount of input on our other products. He's been a very influential person at the company, and we look forward to this continuing in the future!
