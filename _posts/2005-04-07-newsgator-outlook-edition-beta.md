It's been a while...but yes, it's finally that time again. :-)

The next version of [NewsGator Outlook edition](http://www.newsgator.com/outlook.aspx?OrgFrom=Business) will go into beta testing sometime next week, and we're soliciting folks who would like to help with the beta program.  I can't yet post the complete feature list, but it's mostly about synchronization.  If you think back to all of the comments that have been made over the last year about NewsGator's sync system (doesn't sync read/unread status to Outlook, stuff deleted online after I download, etc.), they've all been addressed.  Ok, maybe not ALL, because I know someone's going to scour the forums for something we didn't implement...but pretty much all of the major items have been addressed.  This is an entirely new synchronization system, built on the new API's I [talked about](/gregr/weblog/2005/02/09/newsgator-platform-roadmap-where-are-we-going/) a while back...and I can tell you, after using it for a while, it rocks.

So anyway, if you'd like to participate in the beta, [shoot me a note](/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx).  We're going to limit the size, and we're also going to ramp it up gradually; so if you send me a note and I don't get back to you right away, don't worry - I haven't forgotten you!
