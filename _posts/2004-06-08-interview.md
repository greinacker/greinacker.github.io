Continuing his series, Harold Check has published an interview with me on his weblog - [The New Net Architects, Part IV - Greg Reinacker](http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/6562468581380992/ "http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/6562468581380992/"). A quote from the interview:

> *Syndication will change things. For a taste, look at the early adopters of syndication technology, and how much they say it has changed their online habits, and how much it has changed their lives.*

I very much enjoyed reading his earlier installments of this series with [Luke Hutteman](http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/7932727748437038/ "http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/7932727748437038/"), [Mark Fletcher](http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/7931605515082472/ "http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/7931605515082472/"), and [Brent Simmons](http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/5225556132366423 "http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/5225556132366423")...check them all out!
