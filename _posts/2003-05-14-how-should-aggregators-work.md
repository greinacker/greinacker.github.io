(warning: blatant NewsGator plug ahead!)

Ok, so I'm a little bit behind. :-) In a [post back in April](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/23#When:7:44:43PM), Dave Winer says:

> *RSS readers that work like [Usenet readers](http://www.techcorps.org/webteacher/winexp/newsgroups/open-screen2S.gif) are a waste of time, imho. Aggregators should not organize news by where items came from, just [present the news in reverse chronologic order](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/2002/06/11/newsaggregator1.gif)*

He got some [agreement](http://paolo.evectors.it/2003/04/24.html#a1587), and some [disagreement](http://www.xl8.net/Blog/posts.aspx/544e804e-0de4-4e13-a71f-8bcdf2266d3f).

My vote? Why not use an [aggregator](http://www.newsgator.com) that will do both?
