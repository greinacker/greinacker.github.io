From an interesting article about RSS and marketing by Dick Stroud, in [What's New in Marketing](http://www.wnim.com/issue22/pages/new_media_innovation.htm), issue 22.

> *Until recently, if I wanted to view IBM's RSS channels, it required a software program called an aggregator, sometimes called a newsreader. \[...\] While this is useful I think it would have only been used by the techno-geek community if it had not been for a company called* <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/" target="_blank"><em>Newsgator</em></a>*.*
>
> *Other than a Web browser the software that people spend a frightening amount of their life gazing at is Microsoft Outlook. Newsgator had the brilliant idea of enabling Outlook to receive and view information from RSS channels.*

Thanks Dick!
