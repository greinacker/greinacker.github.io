I've added the RSS 2.0 element to my [comments feed](/gregr/weblog/commentrss.aspx), which will make it easier to tell at a glance who posted the comment. Maybe [Sam](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/) will follow suit - his comments feeds are pretty active...

[NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/) users, just make sure the "From" column is part of the view for that feed, and you'll be all set!

**Update**: it would be cool if those of you who have combined feeds for multiple weblogs would support this as well. [Mike](http://erablog.net/) already does this for the [EraBlog combined feed](http://erablog.net/filters/$EraBlog.rss10) (with dc:creator, pretty much equivalent to author); [Scott](http://aspnetweblog.com/), how about [dotnetweblogs.com](http://dotnetweblogs.com)'s [combined feed](http://dotnetweblogs.com/Rss.aspx)?
