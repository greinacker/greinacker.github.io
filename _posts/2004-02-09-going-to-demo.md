I will be at the [DEMO conference](http://www.demo.com/demo/) next week, participating in a panel about blogging and syndication. Also participating will be [Mena Trott](http://www.sixapart.com/) of Six Apart, [Buzz Bruggeman](http://buzzmodo.typepad.com/) of ActiveWords, and [Robert Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) of Microsoft.

John Patrick, who will be moderating the panel, wrote [a preview of the panel](http://patrickweb.com/weblog/categories/internet_technology/demo2004-1.html) here.

If you're going to be at the conference, be sure to say hello!
