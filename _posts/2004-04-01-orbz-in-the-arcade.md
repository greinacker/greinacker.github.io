This is so cool. A while back, I posted something about my friend Justin Mette, who runs an independent game studio. Their claim to fame, so far, is [Orbz](http://www.21-6.com/orbz.asp) - it was even listed as one of the best games of 2003 (amidst very good company, like Halo and Madden) in [PC Magazine](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1421152,00.asp).

Well, pretty soon we're all going to kiss our quarters goodbye:

> Today, 21-6 is thrilled to announce that we have signed a deal with TLC Industries to put [Orbz in the Arcade](http://www.21-6.com/images/orbz/orbzarcade.jpg)! The arcade version will contain a new mode of play with the focus on cumulative scoring across many levels. If all goes well, Orbz will be in the arcades by summer. \[[21-6 Productions News](http://www.21-6.com/news.asp)\]

Congrats to the 21-6 team!
