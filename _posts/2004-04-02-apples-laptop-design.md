I had a new iBook for a week or so for the recent demo we did at the Consumer Electronics show. I have to agree - it looked good, and it felt good. Apple knows how to design hardware.

However, it did take me at least 5 minutes (no, I'm not kidding) to figure out how to plug the power cord extension into the power adapter. Apparently their target demographic knows to poke and pick at every seam in the plastic, waiting for some kind of cover to pop off?

That was my only complaint though, and only because it made me feel stupid!
