Ok...as mentioned in the comments for my [Event Log Monitoring with RSS](/gregr/weblog/2003/04/03/event-log-monitoring-with-rss/) post, I have been thinking a bit about generating a RSS feed for NNTP newsgroups. This would be a one-way feed, but I think many people might find use for something like this.

If you'd like to try the (very-beta) NNTP RSS feed, [let me know](/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx). Because of the resources used by this feed, I'm not opening it up to the public completely at this time; but if you email me, I will send a URL and credentials so you can try it. This will probably be limited to the first 10 or so people. I'm not sure how long I will keep this running; however, I will most likely post the source at the end of this exercise.

Note that this beta feed is limited to groups on news.microsoft.com.

On a related note, we are considering adding the ability to read NNTP newsgroups into NewsGator in a read-only manner. Subscribing to this test RSS feed will give you an idea what that might be like from the user's perspective, so you can decide if you'd think it would be a valuable feature.

If you participate, you'll be expected to provide feedback on whether you think this would be a useful feature to have built into NewsGator...and even if you don't participate, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Please leave comments on this post!
