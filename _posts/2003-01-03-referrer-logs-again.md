In an effort to deter [unscrupulous hackers](/gregr/weblog/2003/01/02/improved-referrer-logs/#comments) :-), I have modified the referrer log code to indicate which links either a) could not be followed, or b) could be followed but did not appear to link to the post in question.  
  
At some point in the future I may remove the unverifiable links completely. On the other hand, it's interesting to see referrers from news aggregators and the like. Anyone have any thoughts about this?
