In case you've missed it, there has been some great press recently, mentioning [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) and [NewsGator Online Services](http://services.newsgator.com):

[New York Times: Fine-Tuning Your Filter for Online Information](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/03/technology/circuits/03basi.html?ex=1086926400&en=fb7466461d362584&ei=5062) (June 3, 2004)

> *"There is also a subscription service that can coordinate your news feeds across several devices - say, a cellphone, a home PC and an office computer - so that you never inadvertently read the same headline twice. It can even be directed to send traffic information only to your cellphone and movie news to your home computer."*

[Detroit Free Press: Keep Track of Web Favorites](http://www.freep.com/money/tech/rss2_20040602.htm) (June 2, 2004)

> *"Among a new generation of software and services that shield the underlying complexity of RSS are two new products from NewsGator Technologies...both products are well designed and show a degree of professional polish missing from many first-generation efforts."*

And an excellent in-depth review of both products in EContent Magazine's May issue:

[EContent Magazine: NewsGator 2.0 & NewsGator Online Services: EContent Decision Maker Review](http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=6445) (May 1, 2004)

> *"NewsGator takes this product - and news aggregators in general - to a new level."*
