I'll be at the [PDC conference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc) for most of this week, along with two of our system architects...if you're there, and you'd like to meet up and chat, [send me a note](/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx).  I'll also be on a panel, "[The Future of RSS](http://commnet1.microsoftpdc.com/content/sessionview.aspx?TopicID=524efeda-c77d-4358-8dd6-62e0be18a234)", on Friday morning - be sure to stop by!
