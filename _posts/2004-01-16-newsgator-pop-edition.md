Continuing in the series of posts describing NewsGator 2.0 and NewsGator Online Services:

One of the most common question we get is some variant of:

> *Does NewsGator work with Entourage? Outlook Express? Eudora? Lotus Notes?*
>
> *I love the idea of reading RSS feeds in my email client, but I hate Outlook. Do you have a version for \[insert mail client here\]?*

Up to now, the answer has been no...but with POP Edition, part of [NewsGator Online Services](http://www.newsgator.com), we now have a solution.

POP Edition works with any POP3 email client, which is just about every email client out there. You simply add a new email account to your client, point it to the NGOS server, and you can then retrieve your content as mail messages into your client.

It's configurable, so you can make decisions about how the message will be formatted, and where the feed name will show up. We do this to make sure no matter what email client you're using, you'll be able to sort and group your messages the way you want, and build rules to sort them into folders if you like.

And of course, it works with the NGOS synchronization system...so your subscriptions follow you wherever you go, and you never have to read the same thing twice. And if you change settings on your client like whether to leave messages on the server, or delete them, those settings are respected by the sync system - so it will just do the right thing, as you would expect.
