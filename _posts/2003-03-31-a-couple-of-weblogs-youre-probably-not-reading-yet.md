[Sean Varley](http://www.cornerstonedesign-inc.com/weblog/) has an [interesting post](http://www.cdg-i.com/weblog/2003/03/29.html#a27) talking about embedded processors and trends in that market:

> *Processors sales run 50 billion dollars a year, but 98 percent of them are invisible.  The truth is that only 2 percent of all the processors sold actually go into your regular old PC...*

And a big welcome to [Tom Walker](http://www.ingeniumtr.com/tom/weblog/), who just launched his weblog yesterday while we were eating pizza and watching [Alias](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/alias/). Tom usually has something intereresting to say - watch his weblog!
