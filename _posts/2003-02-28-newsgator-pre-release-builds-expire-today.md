Just a reminder...if you're using a pre-release 0.x build of NewsGator (or even the old olnews.exe), today is the last day those builds will function. I encourage you to [install version 1.0](http://www.newsgator.com) and give it a try!

If you're using version 0.7 or later, the NewsGator 1.0 installer will upgrade your installation, and your subscriptions will remain intact. If you're using an earlier version (before 0.7), and I know there's a few of you :-), you will need to uninstall first before installing 1.0.
