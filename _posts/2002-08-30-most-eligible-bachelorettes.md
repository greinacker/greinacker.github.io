Congratulations to [Sandra Bullock](http://msn.eonline.com/Facts/People/Bio/0,128,36,00.html) for being E! Online's [most eligible bachelorette](http://entertainment.msn.com/celebs/features/hotbabes.asp).  I'm posting this in the hopes that maybe she'll read this, think I must be the nicest guy ever, and call me.  :-)

And really, I think [Britney Spears](http://msn.eonline.com/Facts/People/Bio/0,128,68276,00.html) got robbed - \#22?  Britney, you can call too.

Sorry for the off-topic ramble...but we can't talk about .NET and web services *all* the time!
