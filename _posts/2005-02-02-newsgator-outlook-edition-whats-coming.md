Well it's about that time...we're actively working on the next version of NewsGator Outlook edition. Parts of the development are in progress, and the rest of the requirements are being finalized.

Here's the question for you. What's the killer feature that you'd like to see in the next version of the product? We have a lot of data about things customers have requested, and there are already a lot of cool things planned, but I'd like to pose the question directly. Close your eyes, and imagine...

What should be in it? Let us know - we're definitely listening!
