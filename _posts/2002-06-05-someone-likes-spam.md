> [*This guy apparently does not get as much spam as the rest of us*](http://news.com.com/2010-1076-915523.html)*. He also does not realize that most spammers are illegally using the hardware and bandwidth of unsuspecting companies to send out their spam. This is where his "junk mail" and spam comparison falls apart.*

Is this guy for real? I myself get probably 35 spam messages/day in my unfiltered account; and probably that number again in another filtered account. It's gotten so I have to maintain an [unmonitored account](mailto:gregnews@rassoc.com?subject=You%20won%27t%20get%20this%20message%21) for usenet newsgroup postings. I think the guy who wrote this article must get maybe 5 spam messages a day, and they're a manageable distraction at that point.
