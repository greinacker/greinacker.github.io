Back at the MIX06 conference in Las Vegas, I [demonstrated synchronization](http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2006/04/15/576751.aspx) live and on-stage between Vista, IE7, and the NewsGator platform (including FeedDemon, NetNewsWire, and an early build of our windows mobile product).

Today, I'm proud to be able to point you to the first public beta of [NewsGator Desktop Sync](http://blogs.newsgator.com/inbox/2006/09/newsgator_deskt.html).  This will fully synchronize your NewsGator subscriptions (including our clients such as FeedDemon, NetNewsWire, etc, when running in sync mode) with Vista and/or IE7 and their included RSS platforms.

[As I've said before](/gregr/weblog/2006/04/05/newsgator-ie7-microsoft-and-my-first-fanboy-accusation/), Vista and IE7 are going to have a big impact on syndication as we know it...and as promised, NewsGator is extending that experience beyond the desktop.  If you're running IE7 RC1 or later, or Windows Vista RC1 or later, download it and give it a try!
