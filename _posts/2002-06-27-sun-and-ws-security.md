> [*Good news for WS_SECURITY*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/06/27.html#a626)*.* [*Sun switches gears on security*](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-20092407.html?tag=pt.rss..feed.ne_20092407)*. Microsoft, IBM and VeriSign submit a security specification for Web services to an industry standards body, a move that has won the backing of an unlikely supporter: Sun. \[*[*CNET News.com*](http://news.cnet.com/?tag=pt.rss..feed.fd)*\] \[*[*Sam Gentile's Radio Weblog*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/)*\]*

This is great news.  I'm [still skeptical](/gregr/weblog/2002/06/14/sun-and-web-services/) about Sun's commitment to playing with everyone else in the web services space, but this news is the most promising thing I've seen from them yet.
