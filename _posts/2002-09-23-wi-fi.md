Well, it had to happen sometime.  The free Wi-Fi access at Denver International Airport (as reported [here](http://80211b.weblogger.com/2002/08/10)) is no longer free.  It's now being sold on a per-day basis by AT&T Wireless.  I don't remember the cost, but I think it was somewhere around \$12 for 24 hours.

I've also seen a lot of newsgroup and forum posts denouncing [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/retail/wireless.asp) and [T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobile.com/hotspot/) for the high cost to use their system.  Well, I had an opportunity on this recent trip to use their service, and I think it's not so bad for business use.  Compared to the modem in the hotel, this really saved me a lot of time, and more than paid for itself.  Now, at those prices, I won't be surfing the net and cruising chat rooms from Starbucks, but for e-mail and other essential business items, it worked out fine.

I also found service in the Seattle-Tacoma airport, for, I believe, \$7/day.  Seems expensive, but worth it when I had an hour to wait and was able to catch up on some things.
