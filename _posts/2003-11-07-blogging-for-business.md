I'm pleased to announce that I will be participating in a teleseminar called "[Blogging for Business](http://www.wordbiz.com/blogging_teleseminar_nov20.html)", where we'll be discussing, believe it or not, blogging and RSS in business scenarios. [Debbie Weil](http://www.debbieweil.com/) (author of the [WordBiz Report](http://www.wordbiz.com)) is putting it together, and [Dave Taylor](http://www.intuitive.com/blog/) (of *Teach Yourself Unix in 24 Hours* and *Solaris 9 for Dummies* fame) will be participating as well.

I can't remember the last time I was accused of being a "business guy", so this should be fun! I encourage you to check it out if you have an hour to spare on November 20th.

Disclaimer - I have no financial interest in this seminar - I just think it's a great idea!
