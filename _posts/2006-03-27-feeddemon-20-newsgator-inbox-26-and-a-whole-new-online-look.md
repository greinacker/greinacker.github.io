Well, the teams are exhausted :-), but this is a HUGE multi-product release day!

First, [FeedDemon 2.0](http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=FeedDemon).  It's been a long time in coming, but now it's done.  It of course includes [FeedStation 2.0](http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=FeedStation)...but FeedStation is also available as a separate download if you want to grab it separately to use just with NewsGator Online or NewsGator Inbox.  A huge thanks and congrats to [Nick Bradbury](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/03/feeddemon_20_is.html), who I think has been on a caffiene high for quite a while getting this release ready.

Next, [NewsGator Inbox 2.6](http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NewsGator+Inbox).  As I [mentioned earlier](/gregr/weblog/2006/03/21/newsgator-inbox-new-name-new-release/), we changed the name of NewsGator Outlook edition to NewsGator Inbox...and added a ton of new features that folks have been asking for.  More thanks and congrats here go to Nick Harris (who still doesn't have a blog, but now that I've mentioned it twice maybe he will!), who I think worked himself right into the ground preparing this release with his team.

[NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NewsGator+Online) now has a whole new look.  It adds a number of small features, like favicons and such...but the real news here is it has set us up to quickly add a ton of new features and capabilities that are on the backlog.  And the purchase process for new products is finally as easy as can be, integrating multiple products and subscriptions in a way that makes sense, and old subscription plans have been consolidated into the new catalog of options.  A huge thanks and congrats here to the online team - Tim, Demi, Noel, Dede, Brian, and James...and to the platform guys - Darryl, Glenn, Jeff, Gordon, Chris, and Rob.

And finally, as of these releases we've made good on our [promise](/gregr/weblog/2005/07/18/subscription-stuff/) to abolish the subscription model as you used to know it.  Now, you can buy FeedDemon or NewsGator Inbox (and soon NetNewsWire) for \$29.95, and you'll get a free year subscription which includes value-added services such as synchronization (and lots more to come).  At the end of that year, you can choose to renew your subscription if you wish for \$19.95.  But if you choose not to renew, your software will continue to work forever - just without the online-specific features.

So all in all, a busy day...let us know what you think!
