On the heels of our [NewsGator Online API](http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/api/default.aspx) launch, NewsGator has announced an [API developer competition](http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/api/contest/default.aspx)...basically, we're looking for the coolest applications that use the NewsGator API, in three categories:

- Windows applications
- Mac applications
- Cross platform/mobile/web applications

First prize in each category is your choice of a Dell D610 or an Apple Powerbook laptop, and second prize in each category is an iPod nano.

So warm up your developer tools, and give it a shot!

\[update: this post still gets a ton of traffic, but the contest is definitely over.\]
