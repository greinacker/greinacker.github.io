> [*A Rant on the .NET Certification Guides*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/06/21.html#a584)*.* [*I thought Microsoft*](http://www.angrycoder.com/article.aspx?cid=10&y=2002&m=6&d=20) *wanted more people to pass their MCSD .NET certification exams. Apparently not, when you look at their .NET certification guide books. \[*[*Sam Gentile's Radio Weblog*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/)*\]*

I have mixed feelings about "certification guides" like the ones talked about in the article above.  I strongly feel that certification should reflect experience with a technology; not just that you studied very hard and passed a test.

Back when I was teaching a Microsoft MFC class, I met a guy who took the certification test something like 6 times and finally passed it.  He then went to a customer to teach the class, and they threw him out on the first day for an obvious lack of experience. 

Certification should mean something...and something more than "hey, I bought the book, and I remember every page."
