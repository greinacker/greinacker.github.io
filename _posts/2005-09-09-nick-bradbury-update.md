As many of you know, Nick Bradbury had [surgery](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/08/earache_my_eye.html) on Tuesday 9/6 for an acoustic neuroma.  I'm happy to report that the [doctor didn't sneeze](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/09/having_my_head_.html) - Nick is doing very well, is in good spirits, and has started his rehab process.

Please join me and all of us at NewsGator in wishing Nick and his family well, and a speedy recovery.
