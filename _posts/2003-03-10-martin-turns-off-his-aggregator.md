Wow...I found this post from [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) while trolling for posts about [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) (which I do a couple of times a week). [Martin Sutherland](http://www.sunpig.com/martin/archives/2003/03/07/on_life_without_an_rss_aggregator/) writes this about NewsGator:

> *Even if you don't use Outlook, it might even be enough to make you switch. (I had been using Mozilla mail until January, and NewsGator was good enough to make me suffer through the hell of converting my email from Mozilla to Outlook so I could use it. Now that's impressive.)*

Now, I can't help but re-publish a quote like that. :-) But right before that, he says:

> *But I'm not using it any more.*

Basically, he said he's spending way too much time reading blogs, and not enough time on everything else. It's kind of funny, because I've gotten a number of comments via email from people saying the only thing they don't like about NewsGator is that it makes it *too easy* to read lots of news sources, so they read more of them (good) and spend more time with them (not so good).

I've noticed this a bit myself; since I've used an aggregator that works the way I do, I read more weblogs and other news sources. And as weblogs gain in popularity, I'll find more that I want to read. At some point, I'll have to start cutting some of them out - there's only so many hours in the day, after all. But that day will be an interesting one - if most interesting content is available via a syndicated feed, and everyone has an aggregator...
