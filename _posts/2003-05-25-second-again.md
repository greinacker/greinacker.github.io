Another interesting day...practice was fine, if a bit cool. During qualifying, I lost my transmission...ok, well I didn't lose it literally, but it wasn't working very well. Had to get a new one put in before the race. That's a part of racing you have to get used to - things don't last like they do in your street car. I think the transmission probably had 13-15 race weekends on it. If you want to run in the front in our class, you're looking at 1-2 motors and 1 transmission per year, on average. Not to mention an entire set of tires for each national race, on average.

So crap, after all that, I finished second again today. I qualified second, led part of the first lap, and then Kim got by again, and he stayed about 3 car lengths ahead for the remainder of the race. :-( Tomorrow is the day that really counts - Sat and Sun have been regionals, but Monday is a national. Hopefully car and driver will work well together tomorrow and win the race! :-)

Just out of curiousity, do you loyal readers enjoy reading a mix of racing and technical stuff here? I could create categories, I suppose, but I'd rather not...
