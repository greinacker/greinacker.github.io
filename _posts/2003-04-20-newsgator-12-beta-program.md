NewsGator 1.2 is nearing release; we will again have a short, private beta program.  We're looking for about 20 participants to help shake out this release. If you're interested, [send me a note](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx)!  In your note, please include what version of Windows you're running, what version of Outlook, and what version of the .NET Framework you're using (if you know).

I don't have a final change list, but most changes focus on usability.  The following will give you an idea of what to expect:

- Email integration is now complete; in many cases, you can now "reply" to a post to email the author.
- NewsPage enhancements (excerpts, delete buttons, folders expand to show contained posts)
- Moved NewsGator menu to toolbar
- Internet Explorer toolbar button to subscribe
- Links in posts now have tooltip showing where they link to
- Fixed paint problem with progress dialog some users experienced

And several other minor changes/fixes. This will again be a free upgrade to 1.0 and 1.1 users.
