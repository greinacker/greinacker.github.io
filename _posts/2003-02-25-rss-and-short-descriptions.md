[ScottW says](http://aspnetweblog.com/posts/2833.aspx):

> *I am going to release an optional "short-description" feature tonight that I hope everyone will use for posts longer than a sentence or two. (instead of the full post text appearing in the feed, only the short-description will appear)*

While I understand Scott's motivation (he needs traffic on his site to support revenue generation), I am in complete agreement with [Brad](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/002252.shtml), [Brian](http://www.codingwith.net/weblog/archive.aspx?postID=39), and others - don't do this and take away the utility of aggregators for everyone. The news aggregator is what makes it possible for me to read so many people's writing; without it, I'd only be able to read a few.

A possible compromise, I suppose, would be to expose both types of feeds - full descriptions, and excerpts, and let the feed consumer decide which feed he wants. Not sure it would help you, but people who have limited bandwidth might like it...
