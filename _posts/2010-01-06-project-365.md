Well, it's been 6 days now, so it seems I'm committed enough to tell you all about this. :-)

Many of you have seen [my photography work](http://www.gregrphoto.com)...however, what I've found is while I do take a lot of photos, they're generally part of some sort of fashion-related shoot, and there's at least as much (often more) time in setting things up and logistics as there is in actual photography. I don't really seem to just get out and take pictures just for the fun of it - so this year I've decided to change that.

Inspired by this [Project 365 article at Photojojo](http://photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/), and many other related posts, I've started a Project 365 of my own. I'll be taking a picture every day in 2010, and posting them on my new site ([Greg's Daily Photos](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/project365/)) \[_note - this site is no longer online; however, the photos from the project are still available on Flickr - click one of the images below to get there._\]. No particular theme, just whatever strikes my fancy that day. Or whatever I see on the drive home. Or whatever's in the airport while I'm waiting for a plane!

So today is day 6. To get you caught up, here are thumbnails of the pictures so far:
