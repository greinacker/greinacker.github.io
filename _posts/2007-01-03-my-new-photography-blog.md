As many of you know, when I'm not in the office here at NewsGator I'm usually doing photography. I started out photographing just about anything, but I've more recently been focusing on fashion work (and a bit of glamour as well).

I've got a lot to say about all of that, and I agonized for a while about where to write about it, whether it should be here on my personal blog or on a new blog. I ended up creating a new blog, [Greg Reinacker Photography - Blog](http://www.gregrphoto.com/blog/), part of the larger [Greg Reinacker Photography](http://www.gregrphoto.com/) site, which focuses on my photography work.

So go take a look, and don't forget to subscribe to my new blog! I have the feed links below...see you there!
