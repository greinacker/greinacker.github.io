I'd like to extend a welcome to my good friend [Sean Varley](http://www.cornerstonedesign-inc.com/weblog/), who has just started a weblog.  Sean's [company](http://www.cornerstonedesign-inc.com/) does electronics and embedded systems engineering and consulting.

It's interesting to read and talk about work on the fringes of what we do.  I talk to Sean a lot about software development issues, and the problems faced in embedded systems are very different than the problems we face in other kinds of software development.  Fun stuff.  And sooner or later, I just *know* I'm going to talk him into building something that will run the .NET compact framework.

Anyway, welcome Sean!
