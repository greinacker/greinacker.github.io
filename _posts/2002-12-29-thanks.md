I forgot to mention a couple of things - and since I don't have anything in yet to edit existing posts, it's gonna have to be a new one. :-)  
  
Many thanks to [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com), who unknowingly gave me some ideas related to archiving and comments, and whose site provided a basis to learn CSS. My new site uses CSS for styling and most of the positioning, with the single exception of the table at the top for the graphics layout. This is my first heavy use of CSS - hopefully I didn't screw anything up too bad!  
  
And also thanks to [Sam Ruby](http://intertwingly.net/blog/) and [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/) for their most excellent [RSS validator](http://feeds.archive.org/validator/), which has proven immensely valuable when generating my RSS feed!
