As some of you may have noticed, we are running [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) ads in some of [InfoWorld's](http://www.infoworld.com) RSS feeds ([example here](http://www.infoworld.com/rss/news.rdf)). These are the first ads of their kind that we're aware of. I think what happens here will, to some extent, set the precedent for RSS-based advertising.

Any comments on this? RAI and InfoWorld both would love to hear your thoughts...
