From [Sean Varley's weblog](http://www.cdg-i.com/weblog/2003/08/22.html#a39):

> Apparently the University of Wisconsin and Netgear have a problem.  It looks like Netgear hard coded the SNTP IP address into some embedded devices for network time sync and now the school gets the pleasure of servicing a few hundred thousand requests per second.  You can read about it [here](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~plonka/netgear-sntp/#ToC18).

Wow...seems to me the moral of this story is twofold.

\#1 - don't ship a product that beats the crap out of someone else's server.

\#2 - don't ship 700,000 units of your product until you're pretty sure you've taken care of \#1.

Yikes!
