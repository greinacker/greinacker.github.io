I have not posted anything about the war on my weblog before, and I don't intend to make it a habit. But I'm going to just this one time. I had lunch with my sister today, and she told me of a good friend of hers whose son is a marine in Iraq. This young man wrote a letter to his mom, which included two questions (paraphrased here):

> *I hear a lot about the protests, and how people back home are so opposed to this war and what we're doing...why?*

and

> *It doesn't seem like there's a big display of patriotism back home right now, like there was after 9/11 (people displaying flags, etc.). Why not?*

Good questions - and not questions I want our troops to have to think about, while bullets are flying past their heads.

I, for one, am totally 100% behind our troops and what they're doing. I don't necessarily agree with everything our administration does, but once the decisions are made, they have my full support. The time for protest has passed.

And I'm going to look for a flag to put outside my house. I'm proud to be an American. And if any of our troops or their families read this, I'd like to say thank you.
