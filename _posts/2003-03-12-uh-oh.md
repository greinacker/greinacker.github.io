Well this is pissing me off...newsgator.com has had some major issues since sometime last night:

> *Server Application Unavailable

I tell you, I've been with my current hosting provider for some time, but ever since they were acquired by a certain other company, things have gone downhill in the reliability department. I'm not going to name them here (yet), as I'm hoping they get this fixed in a hurry and don't want to piss them off. :-)

Anyone have recommendations for a high quality .NET hosting provider? I've heard good things about [maximumasp.net](http://www.maximumasp.net), but I'm worried about their 2Mb/sec bandwidth throttle - we have times that go way over that. I've also heard good things about [rackspace.com](http://www.rackspace.com), but only on the Linux side. Anyone?

**Update**: it's back up now, but I'd still like to hear some recommendations from you...
