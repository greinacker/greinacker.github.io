I'll second that!  This *is* interesting...although I'm not completely sure I understand the point.  I do disagree with the scenario he lays out, though:

> *"Everything is going fine and dandy when one day, the source company is forced through circumstances to change their \[XML\] data format.  \[...\]  In the x++ case, the entire x++ object with the data is shipped off and the destination company's XML client code can access the methods of the object and get the data-- without caring what the actual data format is lexically!"*

In my experience, the lexical format isn't always what causes problems in the interop case.  If the source vendor adds a new data field, the client vendor has to modify his code to take advantage of the new data in a meaningful way.  So even if operations are packaged with the code (as in x++), the client must still change to deal with data additions/deletions.  The obvious exception is if the data is purely reorganized, in which case the above scenario is valid; but I think this is not the most common case.

And one other thought...in transaction- and service-oriented architectures, we have taught ourselves to separate data from actions; separate nouns from verbs.  X++ thrives on the merging of code and data.  Interesting.
