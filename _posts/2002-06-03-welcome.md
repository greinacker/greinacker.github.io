Well...here I am in blogger-land.  Many thanks to [Gordon Weakliem](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/) and [Jon Udell](http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/) for getting me up and running, and getting my subscribed list working.  Radio seems to be a much more complex beast than immediately meets the eye.

I'm having a lot of trouble with Radio FTP'ing to my server.  The symptoms are timeouts at some time during the upload process.  If anyone has any ideas, [let me know](mailto:gregr@rassoc.com)!
