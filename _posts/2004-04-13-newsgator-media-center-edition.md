By now you've probably seen the [announcement](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=34) for NewsGator Media Center Edition - we're very excited about this! There is a lot more info [here](http://services.newsgator.com/ProdInfo_mce.aspx), including [lots of screenshots](http://services.newsgator.com/ProdInfo_mce.aspx). Check it out! Here's one as a teaser:

Yep, that's a video stream from a RSS enclosure playing in the lower left corner. One more click of the remote, and it's [full screen](http://services.newsgator.com/images/tour_ngmce8.jpg). (And yes, it's from Microsoft's [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com) video feed)

I think by itself, reading RSS feeds on your TV is interesting...but I also don't think anyone is going to use the TV as their sole source of text content - if you don't have a HDTV, it's a heck of a lot easier to read text on your computer screen. BUT...when you combine content like this on your TV, with the synchronization capabilities of [NewsGator Online Services](http://services.newsgator.com), you have a much more compelling story. Read/view some of your content on TV, including multimedia. Perhaps during commercials. :-) Read other (overlapping) content on your desk. Read some of it on your mobile phone. And the system keeps track, the whole time, of what you've read and where - so you don't have to waste time.

Whew! That sounded like a marketing blurb, right off of my own keyboard. Sorry about that. But come on, I have to say cool things about our new products! But maybe others can say it better - here are a couple of quotes from this morning:

[RoudyBob](http://roudybob.net/archive/2004/04/13/555.aspx) - *"They are way ahead of the game here."*

[Omar](http://www.shahine.com/omar/PermaLink,guid,16c0484c-3594-4133-9524-14c168489917.aspx) - *"I've been using this for a few weeks and it's damned cool."*

[Matt](http://blog.mattgoyer.com/2004/04/13.html#a3398) - *"This is very slick."*

And I'll leave you with one more quote, from this morning's press release:

*"NewsGator Media Center Edition is a great example of cutting edge ISV innovation on the Microsoft platform,"* said Sanjay Parthasarathy, corporate vice president of Developer and Platform Evangelism at Microsoft Corporation. *"The deep integration of technologies like XML and RSS, combined with rich multimedia, and presented on a device as pervasive as the television, gives consumers access to the information they care about, where and when they want to view it, truly delivering on the vision of a connected home. We're proud to work with NewsGator to help bring this innovative application to market for our mutual customers."*
