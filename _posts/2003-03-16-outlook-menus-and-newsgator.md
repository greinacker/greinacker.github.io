I recently received an email about the [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) menu in Outlook, which right now is added to the main Outlook menu bar. The person pointed out that if all add-ins added their menu to the main Outlook menu, we'd have a mess on our hands...and he suggested perhaps moving the menu to the NewsGator toolbar. [SpamNet](http://www.cloudmark.com/products/spamnet/) does this now - the "Cloudmark" button on their toolbar drops down their menu:

Seems like a reasonable idea, and a nice side effect would be it would eliminate the menu bug we have on Outlook 2000; but there's something nice about just having the top-level NewsGator menu also. I'm on the fence.

What do you think?
