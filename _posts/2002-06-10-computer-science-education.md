**Computer Science Education**

Hmm...that's an interesting idea!  As far as the CS curriculum goes, however, I think every CS student should have to learn some flavor of assembly language, and should also have to learn C.  After that, sure, teach them J2EE or .NET or the next great thing; but if you don't learn the lower level stuff, in my opinion, then you're really never going to completely get it.
