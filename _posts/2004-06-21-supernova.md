For anyone who's going to be at [Supernova](http://www.pulver.com/supernova/), be sure to check out the "Spam and the Future of Email" panel Thursday at 4:30pm...I'll be on that panel, joined by some folks from Cloudmark, Turntide, and Oddpost. My contribution to the panel is obviously in the relationship of RSS and email, and how RSS can potentially help with the spam problem for certain categories of email.

And even if you don't go to that panel, be sure to find me and say hello if you're at the conference!
