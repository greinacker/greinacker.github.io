The second round of the [Enterprise 2.0 Launchpad videos](http://launchpad.enterprise2conf.com/) are online, including a new video from NewsGator. We took a different approach than the others - rather than just a screencast, we made a spoof of The Office, showing how NewsGator Social Sites totally rocks all over the status quo.

So if you can spare two and a half minutes to watch it, head on over and vote for us! The 4 winners will be presenting their solutions on stage at Enterprise 2.0...and I promise you're going to want to see the new stuff we'll have at the show. :-)

Here's the voting link: <http://launchpad.enterprise2conf.com/>. Make me proud!
