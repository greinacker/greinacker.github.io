It's not often I'm blown away by how well something works, but this time I am.

With Outlook 2003 and NewsGator installed, create a Search Folder to display unread messages in your news folder. By default, they will be grouped by folder - perfect! This really takes the place of what the NewsPage does for OL2003 users.
