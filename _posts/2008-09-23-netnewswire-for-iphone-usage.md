Josh Larson on NewsGator's Media and Consumer team has a blog post up with some [usage stats for NetNewsWire for iPhone](http://blogs.newsgator.com/newsgator_widget_blog/2008/09/netnewswire-iph.html) in its first 9 weeks or so since release. Go take a look...over 200,000 users, and over 115,000 new-to-NewsGator users have signed up in the last 30 days.

We have some other data as well that's more difficult to explain, so we didn't publish it...but generally, what we're finding is users of the iPhone app are sticking with it and using it regularly. Said another way, the abandonment rate of iPhone users is quite a bit lower than our average rate (which is already fairly low, but the difference is significant). It seems the combination of NetNewsWire and the iPhone is a winner!
