Chances are you don't know me...so I thought I might give you a quick introduction. 

By day, I'm a .NET consultant, doing consulting and training work.  I'm just coming off a long-term engagement with [Galileo](http://www.galileo.com/), where I worked with [Gordon Weakliem](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/).  I've been working on web services for quite some time; in fact, we deployed a product into production in 9/01 using web services (with a custom C++ SOAP listener - fun!).

By night (weekend, actually), I [race cars](http://www.laruemotorsports.com/).  Much more of an adrenaline rush than writing code, believe it or not.  ;-)
