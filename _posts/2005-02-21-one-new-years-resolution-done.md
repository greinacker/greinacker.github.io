I didn't post about it...but one of my new years resolutions for this year was to clean out my email inbox.  I believe at the beginning of the year, I had about 500 unread messages, and about 1500 total in that folder...I was using it as an every-growing to-do list.  It hit critical mass a couple of weeks ago, with over 1000 unread.

Some friends told me to just archive the whole thing and start from scratch...but I just *knew* there were things in there I should respond to. So over the last week or so, I've been cutting it down to size.  And today, on a holiday, I spent about half the day and got it all the way down to empty.  Could I be more excited?

So if you've gotten a flurry of email today, regarding things you've long since forgotten about, now you know why!  And here's to hoping I can keep this better under control now. :-)
