This is the first [full-length review](http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=5522) of [NewsGator Enterprise Server](http://www.newsgator.com/enterprise.aspx) that I've seen.  Lots of screenshots (more than you can see on the NewsGator web site, actually), and lots of detailed information about setting up and using the product.

> *Newsgator Enterprise Server comes with a very good solution covering these requirements. With its ability to synchronise RSS feeds between Microsoft Exchange mailboxes and its own database I was able to have my preferred “Must Read” feeds organised in folders and have Exchange ActiveSync sending this information OTA (over the air) to my Windows Mobile devices.*

There's even a picture of the distribution CD and manuals, and a cool NewsGator mousepad that I didn't realize we shipped with the product. :-)
