James Edelin has been busy:

> I have been using [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/) for the good part of this year.  It is an AWESOME program.  I can already read my SharePoint stuff in it thanks to Harry's WSS RSS [generator](http://www.devhawk.net/projects/SharePointSynd.aspx).  So I was thinking, wouldn't it be great if you could post information to SharePoint using Outlook?  I have taken that idea and worked on creating a NewsGator plugin for SharePoint... \[[Jim's Thoughts](http://jj4.bloggedup.com/mt/archives/000070.html)\]

Wow...very cool, Jim!
