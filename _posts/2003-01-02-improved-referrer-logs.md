title: Improved Referrer Logs

I have reworked the individual page referrer logs to show the title of the referring page where possible, rather than the URL. Here's a [good example](/gregr/weblog/2002/12/29/new-weblog/).  
  
This page lookup is done asynchronously behind the scenes; so in most cases, the referring page title won't show up on the initial view, but it will typically be there within a few seconds.  
  
I'd love to hear your feedback...and a big thanks to Les at [0xDECAFBAD](http://www.decafbad.com) for giving me the idea.
