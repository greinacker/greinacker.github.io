Ok, this is a bit off topic (do I have a topic?), but what is it with people and their cigarette butts?  Just today, I saw 3 separate burning butts ejected out of car windows, burning ashes flying everywhere.  Two of those were on a narrow divided highway with dry grass in the median.  Do people not make the connection between fire on the end of their cigarette and the 200,000 some acres that have burned in the last month in Colorado alone?  Come on, people.  Your car has an ashtray, for crying out loud.  Use it.
