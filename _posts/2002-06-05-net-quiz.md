**.NET Quiz**

> *Take the* [*.NET Quiz*](http://www.dotnetcoders.com/web/Apps/Quiz/default.aspx)*. I missed 1 of 20. It changes a couple of the items. \[*[*Sam Gentile's Radio Weblog*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/)*\]*

Hmm...I missed 1 also.  When I took it again, looking for that perfect score, I missed 1 again.  I think it's rigged.  ;-)
