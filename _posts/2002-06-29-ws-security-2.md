From the announcement: "...experimental implementation for WS-Security's Kerberos and Username Authentication". \[*[*Peter Drayton's Radio Weblog*](http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/)*\]*

Hey, this is very cool.  I've been toying with the idea of writing a WS-Security implementation, but it just hasn't bubbled up the list of things to do...and it never made it to the "really fun" things to do list.  ;-)  Now maybe I won't have to!
