If any of you are going to be in Phoenix, AZ Wednesday for the Vista/Office launch event, be sure to go to the "Better Together" event at 11:00am.  I will be there with Lane Mohler (our enterprise product architect), and we'll be doing some demos in the session. Among the things we're showing are:

\- NewsGator Enterprise Server 2.0 - this is a really early build (it's not even in beta yet), but there's so much cool stuff in here we can't help but show it...including the cool new integration with Sharepoint 2007. This will be the first public demo of this product - prior to this, I can count the people on one hand who have seen it.

\- and a brand new product, which we've never even TALKED about. This one is also super cool, and you'll not only see it in the demo, but you'll be able to play with it yourself afterwards if you're at the show.

So come on up and say hello if you're there, and let us know what you think!
