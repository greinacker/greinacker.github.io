Another in a series of posts describing the new [NewsGator 2.0](http://www.newsgator.com) and [NewsGator Online Services](http://services.newsgator.com):

> *Imagine this scenario. You're at a conference, and your community of bloggers (who are also in attendance) are talking about getting together that night to meet for a drink. You'd love to meet up with them, and put a face to the names. There is a lot of discussion on everyone's blog, talking about where and when to meet.*
>
> *But you're without your laptop. Or the battery died. Or you forgot your Wi-Fi card. Or you just can't get connected. Whatever the problem, you're off the air. But you \_do\_ have your cell phone, which can connect to the net.*
>
> *So you pull up your favorites, click on the link for NewsGator Mobile, and you see a list of the recently updated blogs you're looking for. You click a link, and there it is - the meeting place and time you needed. It doesn't get any easier than that.*

That exact scenario came up this year for me at PDC - and that's when I realized the value of a mobile edition (which was only an early prototype at the time). But more recently, an even better situation came up:

> *You're at a conference, waiting to meet with an important member of the press to do an interview about your company's new product. While you're waiting, you pull up NewsGator Mobile Edition on your phone, and read some comments from people talking about your product, how they use it, and what they think of it. One of these posts is a great testimonial and use case, and you use it in the interview.*

Yep, that one's for real, too. I can't emphasize how cool it is to have instant access to your feeds - any time, any place. Or a subset of your feeds, if you prefer to set it up that way.

And it's not the same as some of the other feed readers for mobile devices. The others make the assumption that you're going to read your content on the device, and the device only. But that's not really the way most people work; most folks tend to use their mobile devices as a *companion* device to their laptop or desktop. And NewsGator Mobile is designed around this premise - tightly integrated with the NGOS synchronization system...so it makes you more productive.
