Looks like the new ACR is available, which includes support for D200 RAW files.  It's not actually on the ACR site yet, but it's on Adobe's public FTP server:

<ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/photoshop/cameraraw/win/3.x/>  (windows)

<ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/photoshop/cameraraw/mac/3.x/> (mac)

Woo-hoo!  It was getting a little painful copying to a Mac, converting to DNG with Lightroom, back to windows, and processing using Bridge/ACR/CS2. :-)
