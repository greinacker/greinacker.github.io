If you're interested in testing a beta release of NewsGator 1.1, [send me a note](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx) to that effect. In your note, include the following: OS version and service pack, and Outlook version number (from Help/About). If you are an existing NewsGator customer, please indicate that fact.

I'm not going to publish a feature list yet, but if you've been needing support for authentication, new message notification, or per-feed update intervals, or been having problems with duplicate posts or your proxy server, you might want to sign up. There are numerous other changes and bug fixes as well.

This will be a private and limited beta; if you're interested, get your request in soon! The beta will likely start late this week.

And finally, 1.1 will be a no-charge upgrade, so if you're about to order 1.0, don't hesitate!
