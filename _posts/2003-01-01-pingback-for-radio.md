[Simon Fell](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/01/01.html#a925) has built a [Pingback client](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/stories/2003/01/01/pingbacks.html) for Radio...very cool! I can attest to the fact that [it works](/gregr/weblog/2003/01/01/trackback-test-post/). :-) This is great! The more pingback or trackback enabled clients and servers we have, the better for all of us.
