Sam Ruby's [wiki](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap) is documenting an effort to define a syndication format, designed to overcome some of the existing issues with RSS (which I won't get into here!). There is quite a bit of popular support so far for this effort, which is nice to see. If you're at all interested in RSS and syndication, I encourage you to go over and take a look! There's also more on [Sam's blog](http://intertwingly.net/blog/).

If a new syndication format grows out of this, [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) will support it (in addition to RSS) in the first release thereafter.
