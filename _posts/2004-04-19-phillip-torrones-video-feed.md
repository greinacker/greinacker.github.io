Many of you probably know [Phil Torrone](http://www.flashenabled.com) - the guy behind [flashenabled.com](http://www.flashenabled.com), who always seems to have cooler toys than the rest of us. :-)

Phil's built a [video feed](http://www.philliptorrone.com/ptvideo/rss.xml), optimized for [NewsGator Media Center Edition](http://services.newsgator.com/ProdInfo_mce.aspx). In Phil's own words:

> *"...basically, with this, i have my own tv station."*

He works for Fallon Worldwide, which is the company behind BMW Films...which is good for us, because Phil's feed even includes his favorite episode from the BMW Films series! Here's a screen shot running in NewsGator Media Center edition:

Nice job, Phil! For any of you already running NewsGator Media Center edition, Phil's feed can be added from the "Featured Feeds" section.
