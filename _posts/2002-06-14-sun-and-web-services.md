> [*Sun plays catch up with Web services*](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-20042766.html?tag=pt.rss..feed.ne_20042766)*. The company, sensing it has fallen behind rivals Microsoft and IBM in Web services leadership, is launching a renewed strategy in an attempt to play catch up. \[*[*CNET News.com*](http://news.cnet.com/?tag=pt.rss..feed.fd)*\] \[*[*Drew's Blog*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0104813/)*\]*

I still haven't seen a lot of evidence that Sun really wants to play in the web services world; at least not the world that's being defined with the initiative of Microsoft and IBM.  And here's a snippet from an interesting [article](http://www.fawcette.com/vsm/2002_05/magazine/departments/guestop/default.asp):

*"The second danger comes from Sun and its ownership of Java. Sun's position on interoperability is "Java everywhere." Web services present a real threat to one of Java's strongest selling points—the ability to write code on any platform that integrates easily with Java code running on other platforms. Sun derives revenue from all Java tools, even those coming from other vendors. Clearly Sun would prefer that organizations look to Java as their interoperability strategy rather than a language-independent solution such as Web services. "*
