Mark Fletcher of Bloglines has been writing some interesting things lately. First, in a response to Jim Louderback's recent article ([discussed here](/gregr/weblog/2004/02/06/jim-louderback-on-newsgator-online-services/)), Mark writes:

> *"I agree with your article on eWeek about Newsgator creating a walled garden."*

I already pointed out how we're not creating any kind of walled garden, and Jim Louderback agreed with that after some discussion. It's difficult to say if Mark knew what we're doing with NewsGator Online Services...I would assume he did, but it's possible he didn't.

Today, [Martin Tobias](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/000556.html) writes on his weblog:

> *"I have used Radio UserLand before, but I will try NewsGator this time. Hope it doesn't come with too much spyware."*

To which Mark responds:

> *"I humbly ask that you give Bloglines, our web-based news aggregator, a try. No downloads, **no worries about nasty spyware**, and it's accessible..."*

Come on, Mark. You know there's no spyware in NewsGator. But by saying there's no spyware worries with Bloglines, you're implying there are worries with NewsGator.

I talk to a lot of press folks - every week. I've mentioned Bloglines to many of them. And I have **never once** said anything negative about it, or even implied anything negative.

So I make a public request of Mark. Please don't spread FUD about NewsGator. I'm sure you're well aware that we have NOTHING to do with the "evil" Gator spyware/adware.
