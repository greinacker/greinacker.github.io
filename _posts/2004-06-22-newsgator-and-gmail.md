[Gary](http://denrael.typepad.com/the_denrael_project/2004/06/newsgator_and_g.html) has cleverly figured out a way to get RSS content from [NewsGator Online Services](http://services.newsgator.com) into his new [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com) account:

> *Now though I've started to play with GMAIL, and the first thing I wanted was to use google's search capability against the many rss feeds I get. It works! I went out and found a pop3 redirector,* <a href="http://www.helexis.com/" target="_blank"><em>Mail Redirect</em></a>* and am testing it against the Newsgator online feed. So far, it's working great, every two hours it goes out, pulls my feeds and redirects them to google.*

Great idea - even though Gmail doesn't support POP3, he's found a way to send content from the NGOS POP edition to it!
