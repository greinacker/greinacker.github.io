If you were previously a [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) user before 1.3, it's likely you've never seen the new NewsGator Tips feed.  If you'd like to subscribe, go to the Subscriptions dialog, click the Add button, and select the Feed Wizard. Choose RSS and continue, select "NewsGator.com Feeds" from the list and click Next, and then choose the NewsGator Tips feed from the list.

And ignore the first tip about using the feed wizard - it's not really applicable if you add the feed this way. ;-)
