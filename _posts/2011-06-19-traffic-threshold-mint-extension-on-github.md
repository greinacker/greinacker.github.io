For those who are using the [traffic threshold pepper](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2011/04/26/traffic-threshold-pepper-extension-for-mint-stats/) for Mint, or those who wish it did just *one* more thing, I've put the source up in a public repo on [Github](https://github.com/greinacker/trafficthreshold). So if you have some ideas, or have found a bug, please feel free to jump in!
