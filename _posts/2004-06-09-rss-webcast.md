I'll be participating in a RSS round-table webcast on Thursday morning, 10:00am PDT. It's free - if you'd like to listen in, you can [register here](http://bittyurl.com/34). On the call will be Mark Fletcher, Mitch Ratcliffe, and Harry Hayes. \[the registration page says differently, but I believe this is the more up-to-date information\]
