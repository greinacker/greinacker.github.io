Ok, Gordon posted this about 3 weeks ago - so I'm a little behind. Very cool, though - he's using the ability of NewsGator to map custom RSS extensions to columns in Outlook:

> [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) can render custom columns. This allows you to sort a folder by your custom field; price, in this case.
>
> In order to support this, you can download and import [custom field mappings](http://www.eighty-twenty.net/ng-price.xml). In the Options dialog, on the Rendering pane. Press the "Column Mappings" button, then "Import", and select the field mappings file you downloaded.
> \[[The 80/20 Solution](http://www.eighty-twenty.net/blog/urn:www-eighty-twenty-net:1090.html)\]

Click through the link to see the picture of this - there's a price column in Outlook for a custom Amazon feed, fully sortable and searchable.

Very nice!
