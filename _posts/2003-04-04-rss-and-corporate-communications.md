Here's an interesting article I found by accident - [PR Tactics - Using RSS for corporate communications](http://www.mediamap.com/expertpr/expertpr_040303_feature1.htm) by Phil Gomes.

> *...since not all announcements are wire-worthy -- despite what your “Assistant Marketing Director, Luxembourg Region,” might try to tell you -- company events of slightly less significance might be posted to the company’s RSS feed as the sole means of transmission, giving subscribers a richer view of the company.*

This is exactly what we do for [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/) - some news is wire-transmitted, but all news is in the [news/updates RSS feed](http://www.newsgator.com/news/rss.aspx).
