We've rolled out some new views in NewsGator Online.  The new options are:

Summary view – this displays a short excerpt of each article, including a "+" expando button to expand the full text of the article.

Headline view – similar to summary view, this shows just the headline from each article, along with the expando button.

Some more detail on the new views is in this [NewsGator forum post](http://www.newsgator.com/forum/shwmessage.aspx?forumid=22&messageid=23616).

Both of these views were inspired by user requests, many of which came from FeedDemon users who had been using these views for quite some time.  They're highly efficient for reading lots of stuff – I encourage you to give them a try.

At the same time, we've rolled out advertising in the NewsGator Online web reader.  Ads are shown alongside excerpted articles only; we do not show advertising against publishers' full-text content.

We'd love to hear your feedback about the new views – let us know what you think, and whether the new views work for you!
