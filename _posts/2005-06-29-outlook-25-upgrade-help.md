After [announcing](/gregr/weblog/2005/06/28/newsgator-outlook-edition-25-is-here/) the Outlook edition 2.5 upgrade last night, a bunch of things have come to light.  Mostly the fact that we haven't really laid out what a user needs to do to upgrade.  So let me try to help things out a bit here.

Outlook edition now comes as part of our subscription plans; in particular, **it's part of the business subscription plans**.  "Consumer" plans do not include Outlook edition.  But, as part of this release, we're giving you a way to upgrade (or extend) your account for free.

After you install Outlook edition, it will ask for your NewsGator Online credentials, and it will attempt to activate itself online with your account.  If, at this point, your account is not a business plan, the product will not activate and you'll get a message to that effect.

So here's what you need to do.

**If you already have a NewsGator Online account:**

1\. Sign into NewsGator Online, go to the NewsGator Manager, click [My Account](https://www.newsgator.com/ngs/subscriber/Account.aspx).

2\. Put in your old Outlook edition 2.0 license key where it's asked for on this page.  That will cause your subscription to be upgraded/extended as appropriate.  If you don't have your license key handy, you can get it [here](http://www.newsgator.com/support.aspx).

3\. Install and activate Outlook edition 2.5.

**If you don't have a NewsGator Online account:**

1\. Go to <https://www.newsgator.com/ngs/order1.aspx>, and sign up for a new account.  Make sure to enter your Outlook edition 2.0 license key in the box, if you have one (retrieve it [here](http://www.newsgator.com/support.aspx) if you don't have it handy).

2\. After you've created your new business account, install and activate Outlook edition 2.5.

Sorry for all the confusion on this...
