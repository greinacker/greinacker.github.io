I got an email today, which was sent to several aliases at newsgator.com.  I was typing up a response, when I noticed the same text of the note on a comment to the recent [TalkCrunch podcast](http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/04/03/episode-4-battle-of-the-online-feed-readers/) (which featured executives from four different RSS-related companies, including myself for NewsGator)...and given that the comment was made in public, I thought I would respond publicly as well.  Here's the comment in its entirety:

This is the first time I'm aware I've been called a fanboy. :-)  Here is my response:

John,

Sorry you feel that way.  Let me try to clarify what I was trying to say, and if you disagree, then we can agree to disagree.

I believe we're in the middle (er, beginning) of a paradigm shift on the internet.  And that shift isn't about RSS; it's not about Atom.  It's about subscribing to content.  Users will come to expect that when they visit a web page, there is a consistent way to subscribe to the content on that page.  If they can't subscribe to some particular site's content, they'll consider it a bug.  They will likely visit their favorite search engines less often - and they will "cruise" less - because the content they care about is being delivered to them.

Microsoft is going to ship IE7 soon, and Windows Vista (including IE7) sometime after that.  Now here's the thing.  I don't think IE7 is the *best* experience for reading this content the user has subscribed to.  But - and this is a big but - it's going to be the first exposure to RSS and subscriptions that millions of people see.

Tidbit - Microsoft said at one point they plan to ship 475 million units of Vista in the first 24 months.  That's a lot.  If I add up the total number of people in the world that have ever heard of RSS, I bet it's a lot less than 475 million.

Anyway, back to my point.  People aren't going to look for subscribe buttons on a site any more; they're going to look for "subscribe" buttons in the browser or client they're using.  That browser might be Firefox, it might be Safari, it might be IE7.  But out of those three, IE is probably going to have the most market share.  That's not fanboy talk - that's real life.

So back to NewsGator.  We've announced that we will have synchronization support for the RSS platform that's contained in IE7 and Vista - I demonstrated it personally on stage at MIX06.  This means people can use the cool auto-discovery and subscribe tools in the browser, and they can use as much or as little of the IE7 reading experience as they wish.  We'll synchronize all of that information to either NewsGator Online, or their internal NewsGator Enterprise Server installation.  Once there, they can use a \_different\_ Vista/IE7 machine to read it, or use their mobile device, or use a rich desktop client like FeedDemon or NetNewsWire, or use a web client from a shared computer, or...you get the point.  We take the RSS experience and extend it off of the user's single machine, while at the same time leveraging the strengths of IE7.

Does this mean we only support IE?  Does this mean we don't love Firefox, Safari, and other browsers?  No!  Our system supports whatever browser you want to use.  Where possible, we integrate with the subscription and auto-discovery mechanisms in all of these browsers to varying degrees.  We're not "biased" in any way - other than we devote resources to the platforms that our customers ask for.

So anyway, John, and everyone else reading this - I'm happy to continue this discussion with you if you'd like.  Just leave a comment below, write on your own blog, or you can even call me - 303-552-3900 - and we can chat.
