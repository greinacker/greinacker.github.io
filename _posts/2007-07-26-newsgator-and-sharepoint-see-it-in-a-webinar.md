As you may have heard by now, we're in beta with a product called [NewsGator Social Sites](http://www.newsgator.com/Business/SocialSites/SocialSites_1.aspx) that integrates [NewsGator Enterprise Server](http://www.newsgator.com/Business/EnterpriseServer/Default.aspx) very closely with Microsoft SharePoint. I'm going to blog about this quite a bit more in my upcoming product roadmap posts, but suffice it to say that the combination of these products makes an interesting Enterprise 2.0 application.

Anyway, I'm doing a webinar on Tuesday July 31, at 2:00pm EDT, with Rob Koplowitz of Forrester Research, and we'll be showing actual product screenshots and talking quite a bit about Social Sites, and the combination of NGES and SharePoint.

You can see my fabulous mug :-) and [sign up for the webinar here](http://www.newsgator.com/Enterprise20/SharePoint/SharePoint_3.aspx), if you're so inclined!
