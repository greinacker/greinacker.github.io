Another great day on Sunday. Tires felt great, car felt great, driver felt great - leading to another pole (by 0.2 seconds over 2nd, and about a second over 3rd). During the race, there was some heavy pressure - another car was within 2 seconds of me for the first 15 laps or so, but finally he went off and lost 15 seconds or so...so I ended up leading flag to flag again. Woo-hoo!

Unfortunately, despite this win, my hopes for winning the division are pretty slim. You're only allowed to keep your best 6 races, so I have to start dropping points. The bottom line is, I'd have to go out-of-division twice. Of those two races, I'd have to win one, and at least finish on the podium in the other one. Not impossible, but not extremely likely either! I haven't made a final decision, but I think I'll "cool the tires" so to speak until heading for Mid-Ohio to prepare for the runoffs.
