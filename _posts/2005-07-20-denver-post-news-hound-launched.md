It was [announced](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=54) back in March...and today, the [Denver Post News Hound](http://www.denverpost.com/newshound) application was launched.  It's a custom Denver Post application, where their customers can view news and other content from the Denver Post and other publishers (including any RSS feeds).  Here's a shot of the main window (click for larger):

If you happen to live in Denver, be sure to check out the full-page ad in the paper that will be running for a while.

This is the first public application built on the NewsGator Media Platform...stay tuned for more! :-)
