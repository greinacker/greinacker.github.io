Well, it's been more than a week since my last posting...and it's probably going to be a bit thin for the next couple of weeks as well.  As much as I want to pour out my thoughts about [binary XML representations](http://radio.weblogs.com/0108971/2002/09/08.html#a77) (seriously!  I think we need such a beast), I don't have time to organize my thoughts about it at the moment.

I'm trying to get ready for the [SCCA](http://www.scca.org/) [Valvoline Runoffs](http://www.scca.org/amateur/club_racing/runoffs/).  This is sometimes referred to as the "olympics of amateur motorsports."  It's at the [Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course](http://www.midohio.com/sportscarcourse/), which is a phenomenal track; probably the most difficult and technical track I've ever driven.  I was out there this last weekend testing and doing a double regional race, trying to get some much-needed track time.  The regionals actually went pretty well; on Saturday, I qualified 7th (out of 28), and finished 1st...and on Sunday, qualified on the pole and finished 1st.  Things are looking good so far, but the [best drivers](http://www.scca.org/amateur/club_racing/runoffs/entry_sportsracer.html#SRF) in the country will be at the runoffs...and my lap times from this past weekend would probably only be good for mid-pack at the runoffs.  My goal this year is a top-ten finish; we'll see how it goes...I need to get some good testing time in at the end of this week, and get those lap times down where they need to be.

So this week, I'm out in Seattle with a client; then I'll be back at Mid-Ohio testing Friday and Saturday, and the runoffs start next week.  So, not sure how much I'll be posting...but I'll probably try to post a couple of quick updates throughout the week next week so you all know how it's going.
