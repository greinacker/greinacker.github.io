I'm as surprised as anyone about the recent round of lawsuits, including the suit against the 12-year old girl. But here's a quote from the girl's mom:

> *"It's not like we were doing anything illegal," said Torres. \[*[*Fox News*](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,96797,00.html)*\]*

This is exactly the problem. No one thinks it's illegal. If you're in the intellectual property business, take note - this *is* a problem.
