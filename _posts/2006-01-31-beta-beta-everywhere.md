This is an exciting first few months of the year for NewsGator and RSS.  Today, NewsGator Outlook edition 2.6 beta 1 was released...see [this forum post](http://www.newsgator.com/forum/shwmessage.aspx?ForumID=22&MessageID=12486) for more information.  It includes support for clippings sync (the first application in our family to include this!), podcasting (with the super-cool [FeedStation](http://www.newsgator.com/BroadcastingHome.aspx)), and lots more.

A couple of weeks ago, we rolled out FeedDemon 2.0 beta 1 (see [Nick Bradbury's post](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/01/ann_feeddemon_2.html) on the topic), with some pretty radical changes including complete sync with NewsGator Online.

And last but not least, we have internal builds of [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) that also sync with [NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com); a few lucky folks got to see this live at MacWorld.  We expect to have a beta release available in the next few weeks.

The coolest part?  As of these three releases, you can use any client you want, on any platform you want - and your subscriptions and content will be seamlessly sync'd between them, and to NewsGator Online.  I've personally been using all three clients and the online system for quite some time now, and it's been smooth as silk.

A quick warning - don't install the beta of any of these products unless you understand what you're getting into.  It's not done - that's why it's a beta.  Stuff will break.  Your dog might get sick.  Your car might quit.  But if you're up for it, give it a shot - you'll get an early look at the future of these products, and we would LOVE to hear your feedback!
