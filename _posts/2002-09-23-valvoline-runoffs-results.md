Well, it's over.  I started 5th, and finished 7th.  In some ways disappointing; for example, I was in 6th, about to make a move for 5th, and I went into a corner a little too hot and looped it.  Stupid mistake, which cost me 2 spots on the track.  But in other ways, it was a great week - and really, I suppose finishing in the top 10 in the national championship isn't so bad!  And I think I won \$1000 as well; and even though this will only pay for 1.5 of the 5 sets of tires I used, I always say that money won is twice as sweet as money earned!  (I usually say this in Vegas ;-)

I also learned a lot these past couple of weeks.  Some of these guys are amazingly good drivers - very consistent, no mistakes to speak of.  And I found that I can, for the most part, hang with them.  There were sessions when I had faster times than nearly all of them.  It's the consistency thing that I need to work on...

I'm thinking about doing the [Pro Spec Racer series](http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/) next year.  We'll have to see how that goes; without funding, it would be a pretty expensive proposition.

So that's it for this year's runoffs.  If any of you are still reading after these last could of weeks, rest assured - I'll get back to technical stuff now!  But this has been fun...so I think I'll keep posting random racing updates.  Hopefully no one will mind...
