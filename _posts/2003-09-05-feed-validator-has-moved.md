This is worth re-posting...the feed validator has moved to <http://feedvalidator.org>.  There are other validators out there, but this is the only one really worth using, IMHO.

> *The Feed Validator, previously located at feeds.archive.org/validator/, now has its own domain: feedvalidator.org. If you have any scripts, templates, or applications that point to the Feed Validator, now would be a good time to update them. \[*[*dive into mark*](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/09/04/feed-validator)*\]*
