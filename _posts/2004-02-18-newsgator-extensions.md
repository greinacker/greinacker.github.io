A couple of very cool new [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) extensions worth mentioning:

[NNTP Posting plug-in](http://www.eworldui.net/NntpPlugin.aspx): [Matt Hawley](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/) has built a plug-in/extension combination to allow posting to NNTP newsgroups directly from NewsGator and Outlook. Very nice!

[FetchLinks](http://graemef.com/blog/articles/565.aspx): [Graeme Foster](http://graemef.com/blog/default.aspx) has built a plug-in which will retrieve the linked content from a web site, for feeds that only provide links or excerpts, and store the content in Outlook.

Nice job, guys! Both of these address very common requests we hear from customers.

We're looking at ways to build a community site so great efforts like these can be more easily found by our customers. More info will follow when we get something together.
