Phil Wolff [interviews](http://dijest.com/aka/2003/08/05.html#a2525) Steve Rose, creator of [RSSJobs](http://rssjobs.com/rssjobs/index.jsp). One part I took note of:

> *Q: What's on your wishlist for news reader features?*
>
> *A: I would like to see an RSS Reader that could manage the items from an RSS feed as individual items. A user could archive specific items for viewing later after it is no longer included in the feed.*

[NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) works this way today. Very important, as we're often reminded from some of our business customers.
