You might not have noticed, if you read my blog often, but we've never actually announced NewsGator Enterprise Server.  Well, all that changed today!

It's officially announced, and will ship in Q3.  Which, if you look at a calendar, is pretty soon. :-)  Here's the info:

[Press Release](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=63)

[Product Info](http://www.newsgator.com/enterprise.aspx) - there are links on this page to the product brochure, white papers, and lots of other cool stuff.

Here's a comment from one of our beta testers:

> *I just got beta 2 of Newsgator Enterprise Server setup.  WOW.  Nice stuff.  Honestly I haven't seen a 1.0 product look this good, well, ever.*

We're pretty excited about it...and now that there is actual information available about the product, I'd love to hear what you think!
