...now with *other* peoples' cars! :-)

Tom Walker has started writing road test reviews of new cars...[here's his first one, on the Mazda RX-8](http://www.ingeniumtr.com/tom/weblog/2004/05/driving-impression-2004-mazda-rx-8.html). Complete with the little 1.3 liter 240 hp gem of a motor that also powers the [Formula Mazda](http://www.starmazda.com) (I *so* want one of those...) Nice job, Tom!
