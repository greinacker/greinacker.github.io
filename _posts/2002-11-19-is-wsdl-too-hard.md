> [*Modeling without WSDL*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0109549/2002/11/15.html#a4)*. Mark Ericson has some thoughts on Interface design with WSDL, I agree with him, WSDL is far to cumbersome to work with by hand, the only way to be remotely productive is to use some sort of tool, personally I like* [*Omniopera*](http://www.omniopera.com/)*, YMMV. * *\[*[*Simon Fell*](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/)*\]*

I've heard oh-so-many people talk about how difficult WSDL is to use, and how it's too hard to create by hand.  Well, I don't buy it.  Yes, it's not exactly intuitive.  But for 95% of the WSDL one might need to create, you could create a boilerplate template and just fill it in.  When doing this, most of the work will be generating your schemas, which there are plenty of tools for (although I usually write schemas by hand).  It's cryptic, it's strange, and you might not understand it all at first...but it's not all *that* hard.
