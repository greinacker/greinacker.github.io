Thanks Gordon.  Working with our team at Galileo was a great experience, and the .NET experience we've gotten from working with the Microsoft e2a team was invaluable.  Unfortunately (depending on your point of view), they decided to switch to Java; but if anyone is interested in doing cutting-edge web service work with Java and WebSphere, I encourage you to contact [Galileo](http://www.galileo.com).
