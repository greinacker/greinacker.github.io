As you can tell from my post last week laying out the [NewsGator product roadmap](/gregr/weblog/2005/02/09/newsgator-platform-roadmap-where-are-we-going/), enterprise products and services are a big part of our future. In support of this, I'm excited to announce that Charlie Wood has joined our team as Vice President, Enterprise Solutions.

Charlie has been involved in the online syndication and aggregation space for quite some time. In 1997 he joined content management vendor Vignette, serving first as a systems engineer and later as an account executive. Ultimately he became Group Product Manager for the company's \$100M content management and syndication product line. He later served as Director of Enterprise Solutions at Stellent, and managed operations for network security startup Permeo Technologies.

You'll probably hear a lot from Charlie in the coming months.  Watch his [Moonwatcher weblog](http://globelogger.com/moonwatcher/), where he writes about RSS and its applications in the enterprise.

Welcome Charlie!
