Yep, it's true...on Friday night, Sep 30 (yes that is [Q3](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2005/10/it_will_ship_in.html)!), the final bits for [NewsGator Enterprise Server](http://www.newsgator.com/enterprise.aspx) 1.0 were burned to a master CD.  It's being duplicated and shipped to customers this morning.

I'm still in a bit of shock. This product has been a long time (about a year or so) in the making...and nearly everyone at NewsGator has had a hand in it in one way or another.

So to the team that got this out the door - you guys rock!

And to that team, I \_know\_ you're all reading my blog...because I pushed out a group subscription to all "Domain Users".  Ah, the perks of being an administrator... ;-)
