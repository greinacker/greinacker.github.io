This has been mentioned lots of places already, but in case you missed it - [ExtremeTech reviews six news aggregators](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1228694,00.asp), including NewsGator. A quote:

> *NewsGator provides an important convenience – operating inside outlook, it doesn't require a separate application to view news feeds Since we use Outlook for email when using Windows, we found it super handy to have our news feeds embedded inside.. This is a unique feature to NewsGator, and if you use Outlook heavily, this product is for you.*
