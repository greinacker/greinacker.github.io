This is going to sound like a strange question, but here goes. Did NewsGator get some press today, somewhere, without a direct link? Like in print, maybe? Today was a **huge** traffic day on <http://www.newsgator.com>, but referrers aren't telling the whole story.

There were a very large number of google hits for the phrase "NewsGator" - we get a fair amount every day, but nothing like today...

So did anyone see anything I might have missed?
