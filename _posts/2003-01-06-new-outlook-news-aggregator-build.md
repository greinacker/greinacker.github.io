Version 0.2 is now [ready](http://www.rassoc.com/olnews/)! Perfect for those folks who refuse to use a 0.1 version of anything. :-) Here's a rundown of what's changed:

- Improved RSS aggregator - removes numerous problems with certain RSS feeds.
- Tray icon now changes (lightning bolt) when news is being retrieved.
- Fixed insertion order of posts, so sorting within Outlook behaves as  
  expected.
- GUI is now responsive during news retrieval operations.
- A retrieval cannot be triggered when a retrieval is already underway;  
  this solves some rare duplicate post problems.
- The check news interval is now saved between sessions.

You can download the application, readme, and release notes [here](http://www.rassoc.com/olnews/). And as before, please post your experiences!
