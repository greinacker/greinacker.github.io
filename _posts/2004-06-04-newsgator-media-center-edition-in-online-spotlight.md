From [today's announcement](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=38):

> *NewsGator Technologies announced that the recently launched NewsGator Media Edition is featured in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004's "Online Spotlight"*

This is pretty cool. Now anyone with a Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 PC can get to NewsGator Media Center Edition without having to download a thing. And when new users are browsing around in the Media Center interface, they will see NewsGator - right next to MSN and ESPN.

So your homework for tonight...go to your local Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA, or whatever your preference. Find a Media Center PC, pull up Online Spotlight, and go into News/Sports. Behold that which is NewsGator...and tell the passers-by that THIS is the reason they need a Media Center PC! :-)

(ok, maybe that was a little over the top...but hey, it's Friday!)
