After way too much pain with the old forum software (which was the old beta [www.asp.net](http://www.asp.net) forum code) being used for the [NewsGator forums](http://www.newsgator.com/forum/), I've finally migrated to a commercial system ([InstantForum.NET](http://www.instantasp.co.uk/products/instantforum/default.aspx))...hopefully this one will work out a little better!

Those of you subscribed to the [forum RSS feed](http://www.newsgator.com/forumrss.aspx) will see a whole set of new posts - the feed is slightly different, so all the posts are detected as new.

Also, if you're an existing user, you'll need to login a bit differently...see [this post](http://www.newsgator.com/forum/shwmessage.aspx?forumid=1&messageid=838) for details.
