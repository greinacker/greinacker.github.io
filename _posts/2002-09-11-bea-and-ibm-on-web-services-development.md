Hmm...does it really matter if it takes 5 clicks or 28 clicks to generate my web service?  Maybe the first time I do it, I might care...but once I'm familiar with the tools, and I know what I'm doing, it doesn't matter too much.  And I'm not going to be able to deploy that 5-click web service anyway - there's a lot more involved in deploying a web service than running through a wizard.

As an aside, I've used IBM's tools (WSAD) for quick-starting web services briefly, and I gotta tell you, it was certainly not as, uh, intuitive as I might have hoped.  Of course I'm probably spoiled by Visual Studio .NET.  :-)
