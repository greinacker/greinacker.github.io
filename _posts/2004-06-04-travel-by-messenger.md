It's not all *that* often that I post about some new technology that I see, but today's going to be an exception.

As some of you know, I used to do development consulting in the travel business. Well today, I was fortunate enough to get a glimse of a new application from [TravelMessenger](http://www.travelmessenger.co.uk/), the likes of which I haven't seen before. It's basically an automated travel agent, which you interact with via MSN Messenger:

Very interesting. It's got some quirks at the moment, but it's a great demo. I'm not completely convinced I would book a trip this way, but maybe - it's definitely got potential. With some good AI work, I think this could become something very different than most of us are used to - in a good way. I'm told this will go into a limited beta next week...
