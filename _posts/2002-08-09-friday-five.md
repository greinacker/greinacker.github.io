> *Time for a* [*Friday Five*](http://smattering.org/archives/00000749.php)*, since it's about cars (something I love more than software development!).  \[[The .NET Guy](http://www.quality.nu/dotnetguy/view.aspx?post=397)\]*

I'm with you - completely a car guy.  My answers:  
  
**1. Do you have a car? If so, what kind of car is it?** Well, my fun, non-daily-driver is a 1989 Ferrari 348.  Very impractical, but oh so fun!  
  
**2. Do you drive very often?** Unfortunately not in the Ferrari; a couple of times a week right now, much less in the winter.  It's almost a crime how much it sits in the garage.  In my daily driver car, yes - I drive a lot.  
  
**3. What's your dream car?** That's hard to say...right now, for a street car, I'd say a Ferrari Enzo, which will be shipped later this year (all 300 or so of them).  For a race car, a F1 car would have to top the list.  
  
**4. Have you ever received a ticket?** Yep.  
  
**5. Have you ever been in an accident?** Not recently, but yes - although my accidents on the street haven't been my fault.  On the race track (more recently), a different story - probably 50/50 between my fault and not.
