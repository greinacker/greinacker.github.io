> *Reading this* [*article*](http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,41488,00.html) *at Business 2.0 about basic techniques for rising through the ranks at Google got me to check my various rankings, and hey, for the first time ever, I'm the* [*number one Dave*](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF8&safe=off&q=dave&btnG=Google+Search) *at Google.  \[*[*Scripting News*](http://www.scripting.com/)*\]*

Hmm.  I'm not even in the top 945 for '[Greg](http://www.google.com/search?q=Greg&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF8)'...  [Brad](http://www.quality.nu/dotnetguy/) is [\#15](http://www.google.com/search?q=Brad&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF8&start=10&sa=N) for his name, and [Sam](http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/) is [\#2](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF8&q=Sam).  Time to get to work on the links, I guess.  I mean, I'm sure [Greg Egan](http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/) is a nice guy, but I want his top spot.  :-)

You can help - [link](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/) to this site!  (was that a shameless plug?  heh)
