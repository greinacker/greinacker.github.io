As you know, we recently made [NewsGator Enterprise Server](http://www.newsgator.com/Business/EnterpriseServer/Default.aspx) [free for up to 20 users](/gregr/weblog/2008/05/20/newsgator-enterprise-server-free-for-20-users/). We've had quite a bit of response to this - thanks to everyone who has downloaded and is using it!

On a somewhat related note, I've decided to make a series of 60-second screencasts demonstrating some of the features of NGES. The first of these is below, on the integrated tagging features.

Why 60 seconds? I mean, as someone mentioned to me last week, the shorter the video the harder it is to edit (so true). My thought here is, everyone has time to watch a quick 1-minute video of something cool...but much more than that is tougher. So, I'm going to give the 60-second thing a shot, and we'll see how it goes. Feedback would be appreciated!

So on to the first video. This shows the tagging system in NGES:
