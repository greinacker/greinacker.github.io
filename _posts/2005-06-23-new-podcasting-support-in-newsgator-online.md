Wow, this is cool. And I'm not just saying that because I happen to work here. :-)

As many of you know, [FeedDemon](http://www.feeddemon.com/) has had cool podcasting support since v1.5, with a helper application called FeedStation. FeedStation did the work of downloading podcasts, and adding them to iTunes or Windows Media Player playlists, for syncing to your portable device. Very cool.

Well, we've taken FeedStation, modified it a bit, and [integrated it with NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com/BroadcastingHome.aspx). You can now find podcasts from within NewsGator web edition, click "Add to Podcasts", and download them to your iPod (or other portable device) using FeedStation.

And the best part? You don't have to be anywhere near your iPod. You might have left it at home, in its dock. You're using NewsGator Online at the office, and you find a few things you want to listen to later. You click the links in web edition, which adds them to the "My Podcasts" folder in NewsGator Online...and FeedStation (which you left running at home) downloads them to your iPod. When you get home from work, they're sitting there waiting for you.  Woo-hoo!

This will all be integrated with NewsGator Outlook edition in an upcoming release (not the one that's imminent, the one right after that).

Since a picture is worth 1000 words, and I'm not a very fast typist, let me just show you. :-)

We're browsing through a feed in NewsGator Web edition, and we see a podcast we want to download.  Just click the "Add to Podcasts" link:

And then you'll see it show up in your "My Podcasts" folder:

FeedStation is running in the system tray:

...and downloads the selected items.

I don't have a picture handy of it working with WMP or iTunes, but I promise it does. :-)

Try it out, and let me know what you think!

Update: [Nick Bradbury](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/ann_feedstation.html) had the same screen-capture-all-over-the-place idea that I did, and posted on his blog about this all as well.
