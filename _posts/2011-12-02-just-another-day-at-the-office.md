Well, ok, maybe another day *out* of the office. :-)

The technical details...onboard footage was filmed in Bear Creek Canyon, just outside of Morrison, CO. It was shot with a GoPro HD; mounted via suction cup to the tank and to the side of the fairing. Other footage is from a Canon HF M40. The bike is my much-loved 2010 ZX-6R, which was badly in need of a bath!
