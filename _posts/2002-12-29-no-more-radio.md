After yet another hour of screwing around with Radio trying to get it to upstream my archives, and after yet more crashes when trying to close it, I've finally replaced Radio with my own weblog application.  
  
I'll post more details soon...but for now, I just wanted to explain why your news aggregator is probably showing my last couple of weeks worth of posts (new generated RSS file). If you're subscribed, please change the RSS location to be <http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/rss.aspx>. The old feed will be removed at some point in the future. Thanks!
