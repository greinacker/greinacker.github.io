Everyone knows by now that the most visible feature of the iPhone's recent software update is the [iTunes wi-fi music store](http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/wifistore.html). When I first saw that, my thought was "ho hum"...I mean, I'm excited that Apple is changing the mobile game and updating devices with new features, but I had very little interest in buying songs from my phone.

Ha. Apple clearly knew better than me.

They completely nailed the interface. It works, it's fast, and it's fun. I was sitting around over the weekend, just browsing through the store. Tapping the "preview" buttons, tapping the "buy" buttons...it's all so easy. And being one tap away from new music, *on your device*, is something that's very cool - and cool enough it's a little hard to explain exactly why. And knowing it will sync back to your PC, and there's no downside to buying on your phone vs. buying from your desktop, really takes the last bit of worry away.

So nice work, Apple. You gave me a feature I didn't want, made it easy for me to play with it even though I wasn't interested, and you convinced me.
