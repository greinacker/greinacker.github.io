NewsGator v0.9 is now available on the [download site](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/). A couple of items that have gotten a lot of attention lately have been changed - NewsGator no longer sends a referrer header, and it now correctly installs and operates for non-admin users. Other changes:

- Posts now marked as read after reading from NewsPage
- NewsGator can now be correctly loaded/unloaded from the Outlook Tools/Options/Other/Advanced/COM Add-ins dialog, including adding/removing all GUI elements. Solves problem of multiple NewsGator menus in certain circumstances.
- Added link for post comments
- Fixed bug on NewsPage when a feed title had an embedded '/' character
- Fixed problem where if logged in twice via terminal services, would get two copies of each post
- When trigger a manual retrieve, reschedule auto retrieve time
- Added keyboard shortcuts
- IE context menu can now be switched on and off from NewsGator Options, rather than being an install-time selection.
- Added start menu folder
- Fixed problem where if NewsGator started up but no folders were accessible, Select Folder... wouldn't work and you'd be in a situation you couldn't get out of
- Fixed problem where under certain rare conditions, retrieving a feed might never timeout

If you run into any problems, or have any new suggestions, please let me know!
