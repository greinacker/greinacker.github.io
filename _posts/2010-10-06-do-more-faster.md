If you haven't yet, you should take a look at [Do More Faster](http://www.amazon.com/Do-More-Faster-TechStars-Accelerate/dp/0470929839), a book by [Brad Feld](http://www.feld.com/wp/) and [David Cohen](http://www.davidgcohen.com/) about the experiences of early-stage investors and entrepreneurs.

I've even got a chapter in there myself, called "Don't Plan, Prototype!" It's essentially a couple of pages talking about the very early stages of [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com), from the [sitting-around-scratching-my-head stage](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2003/01/04/news-aggregator/) up to our [first venture financing](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2004/07/02/newsgators-recent-funding/). I wrote it and slipped it into a stack of manuscripts David had laying around...somehow they didn't notice, and it made it into the book. :)

Anyway, you can [pre-order](http://www.amazon.com/Do-More-Faster-TechStars-Accelerate/dp/0470929839) the book now at Amazon. Check it out!
