The current 1.2 beta release of NewsGator supports posting to your weblog, if you're using Radio, blogger.com, or dotnetweblogs.com. Support for Movable Type and BlogX should be coming soon.

Anyway, we need a few more folks on the beta who are interested in using NewsGator to post to  
their weblogs. If you're interested, [send me a note](/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx)!

It's also very easy to write plug-ins for other weblog systems; if you're interested in doing that,  
I'd be happy to send you some code to get started.

(By the way, this post brought to you straight from Outlook... :-)
