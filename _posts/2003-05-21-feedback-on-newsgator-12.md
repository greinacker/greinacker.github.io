Wow...I'm a little overwhelmed by the great feedback on [NewsGator 1.2](http://www.newsgator.com/). Many thanks to everyone...you all contributed to making yesterday the single largest traffic day  to date on newsgator.com, by a long shot.

And a quick announcement, we will be shipping WMP9 support in all of our [posting plug-ins](http://www.newsgator.com/plugins/default.aspx) within a couple of days. [Matt](http://www.mattberther.com/) has already added this to the Movable Type plug-in; you can download that one immediately.

Here are a few comments about 1.2, for your reading pleasure: :-)
