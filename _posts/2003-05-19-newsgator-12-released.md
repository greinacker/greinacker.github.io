Here are some screen shots of some of the visual items that have changed. This is only a small subset of the feature set...and we're only highlighting changes since 1.1.

The NewsGator menu has moved to the toolbar:

New post items have been added to the menu...

And of course new configuration options:

Outlook auto-preview, which works well with NewsGator, was always hampered by the links at the top of every post, which would fill up most of the auto-preview. There is now an option to move the links, for "clean" auto-preview:

Prior to Outlook 2003, it was unfortunate in that you could never see the URL that a link was going to open; NewsGator 1.2 adds tooltips to most links:

If you like the NewsPage, you'll like it even more with inline post excerpts:

And also on the NewsPage, you can now read all posts from the "unread posts" section by expanding each feed...

Enjoy! We look forward to your feedback and comments.
