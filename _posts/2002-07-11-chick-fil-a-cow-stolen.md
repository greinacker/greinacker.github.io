> *A 150-pound fiberglass cow has been stolen from a Chick-Fil-A billboard in Denver.  \[...\] The cow, one of the company's mascots urging customers to "Eat Mor Chikin," was apparently taken during the weekend. \[...\] Chick-Fil-A is also offering free chicken sandwiches for a year for information leading to the safe return of the cow. \[[Yahoo! News](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020711/ap_on_fe_st/fiberglas_cow_2&e=1&ncid=)\]*

This cracks me up - probably more than most, because this billboard is less than 4 miles from my house.  The article also says *"The little bandits were very innovative"* - heh...they must have [played tag](/gregr/weblog/2002/06/28.html#a35) as children.  ;-)
