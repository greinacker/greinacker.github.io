You've probably heard by now that we've re-launched [NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com), our web-based aggregator, and we've made much of it free. Woo-hoo!

Here's the part that's now free:

- NewsGator Web Edition (the web-based aggregator), which includes recommendations, ratings, clippings, and lots of other cool features
- Blogroll publishing
- Headline re-publishing
- Synchronization with NewsGator Outlook Edition and FeedDemon (and other products in the future)

I'm pretty excited about this, as is our entire team. Formerly NewsGator Online Services, this online system has been around since January of this year...but it's always been behind a subscription wall. Now, we're opening up a large part of the system for free use. I like to think of it as our way of giving a little back to the community that's helped us get this far...but I suppose in reality, we have business reasons for doing it too. :-)

There's so much cool stuff to talk about...for example, the new rating system we have for content. But rather than make you read for pages and pages right now, I'll post more about this and other features in the coming days.

We've gotten some great feedback in the first few days - a few examples:

> [Brian LeRoux](http://www.newsgator.com/forum/shwmessage.aspx?ForumID=2&MessageID=4461&TopicPage=&App=true): *This is the online aggregator I've been waiting for*.
>
> [franck's blog](http://www.sidon.eclipse.co.uk/2004/10/newsgator-online-is-free.html): *The interface is very slick and years ahead of the Yahoo! implementation. If you read a lot of blogs, there is no contest*.
>
> [anonymonk](http://carlos.typepad.com/anonymonk/2004/10/newsgator_onlin_1.html): *In speed and looks it wins easily*.
>
> [roudybob](http://roudybob.net/archive/2004/10/18/1149.aspx): *I'm a big fan of NewsGator - and their online services are phenomenal*.
