Well, I was hoping not to have to do this, but it appears it's inevitable. Here's the comment policy for my weblog:

I reserve the exclusive right to delete any comment left here. Reasons a comment might get deleted (this is not an exhaustive list):

- The comment contains flames or attacks on me or others, as determined solely by me.
- The comment is obviously off-topic.
- The comment contains offensive language.
- The comment promotes illegal activities such as copyright infringement, software piracy, cracking, etc. Note that discussion of these activities is fine; promotion is not.

I will not, however, edit content of any comment, other than to alter the markup in certain cases (for example, to fix a broken link, etc.).
