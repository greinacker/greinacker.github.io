NewsGator 0.6 is [now available](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/). This fixes a few problems:

- Fixed problem where if default mail format in Outlook 2002 was set to plain text, then bodies of posts would not be correctly displayed.
- Fixed problem where if user chose to hide the NewsGator toolbar, it would incorrectly show up again the next time Outlook was started.
- Corrected problem where Outlook 2000 would not shut down completely after NewsGator had retrieved posts.
- Removed "Test Post" menu item, except when running in debug mode (registry switch).

Also, thanks to [Bryce](http://www.ntwizards.net/blog/), there is now a XSL transform available to transform OCS files from NewzCrawler into OPML files that NewsGator can import.  I put the XSL file, along with a tool to run it against your OCS file, on the [download site](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/ocs2opml.zip).

Keep the comments and suggestions coming!
