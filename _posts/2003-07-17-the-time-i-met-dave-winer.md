Ted posted a few days ago about how he met [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com) last week:

> As I mentioned in my blog last week, I briefly met Dave Winer at OSCON last week. I have to admit being a little nervous about it, because I offended Dave earlier in a thoughtless way. But Dave paid me about the best compliment that he could have: "Oh, yeah, I read your blog all the time". \[[Ted Leung on the air](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/07/16#368)\]

I almost met Dave last week at the [Applied XML Conference](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/conference/) (which was excellent by the way - I might post more comments later). On the Friday of the conference, I figure I'll introduce myself to him, since we've talked via email a couple of times but never met in person. So during a break between sessions, I wander over to him, and this is how it went:

Greg: "Hi, Dave, I'm Greg Rei..."

Dave: "Not now." (doesn't look up, but sticks hand up toward me, in "talk to the hand" style). "I'm writing."

Greg: (thinking that's strange, but ok...) "Ok, no pr..."

Dave: (hand up again) "I can't, not now. Sorry. Sorry."

Uh, yeah - whatever. I'm not sure, but I think [this](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2101 "http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2101") is what he was writing at the time. At least it was something important - heh.
