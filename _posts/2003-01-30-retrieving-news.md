If you are having a [problem](/gregr/weblog/2003/01/28/newsgator-v08-released/#comments) where NewsGator seems to stop retrieving news, and the status dialog just shows "Retrieving..." for one or more of the feeds, read on. Each feed should time out within 60 seconds. If you are seeing a feed get "hung up" for more than a couple of minutes, and when you click Cancel All or Get News nothing happens, then please [contact me](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx).
