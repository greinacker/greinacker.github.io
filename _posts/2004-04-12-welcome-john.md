I'd like to publicly welcome John Carmichael to the NewsGator Technologies management team, as Director, Business Development. John comes from a strong marketing and business development background, and we're very excited to have him!

John's first day was today, and his white board is already filled. :-) I'm sure he can't wait to see what will happen tomorrow!

I'll post a link to his weblog as soon as he's ready to be a public figure...within the next week or two, I would suspect.
