I have mixed feelings about [this post](http://www.sageone.net/archives/000150.html):

> *Here's some of the crap that's caught my attention in the blogosphere and in the news using* [*NewsGator*](http://www.newsgator.com) *in Outlook. Love this app.*

So far so good.

> *If anyone has a cracked version, let me know.*

Yikes! Now of course I'm very happy he likes NewsGator. But it seems pretty ballsy to ask for a crack on his weblog. Especially when we could email him (email on his site), IM him (also on his site), or [look up](http://resellers.tucows.com/opensrs/whois/) his mailing address, phone number, and alternate email from his domain registration. Come on, it's only \$29. :-)

Mr. SageOne, if you remove that sentence from *your* post, I will remove *this* post if you ask. :-)
