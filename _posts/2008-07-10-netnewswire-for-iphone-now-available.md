The development of [NetNewsWire for iPhone](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWireiPhone/Default.aspx) just might be the worst-kept secret in NewsGator's history. But hey - that's ok, especially since today is launch day!

NetNewsWire for iPhone uses the NewsGator Online sync platform, so you can use [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx) on your Mac, [FeedDemon](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx) on Windows, [NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NewsGatorOnline/Default.aspx) on the web, or any of our other applications, and they will all sync together. I've talked about this a lot in the past...but this is really the only reasonable way to build a mobile reader, IMHO. We use mobile devices as companion devices, in addition to our desktop and/or laptop computers - they're not the only devices we use.

The first thing to do is head on into the iTunes App Store (click the image below):

Assuming you have iTunes 7.7 installed, that link will take you to the App store, where you can download NetNewsWire:

And then you're all set. Here are a few screenshots while you're waiting for your iPhone 2.0 firmware to download!

Reading an article:

This new app also supports clippings - so you can find articles on your phone that you'd like to read later, and save them in your clippings folders. Those folders are also synchronized to your desktop apps and the online system as well.

If I sound excited, it's because I am. :-) So stop reading now, and go to it!

And did I mention it's free?
