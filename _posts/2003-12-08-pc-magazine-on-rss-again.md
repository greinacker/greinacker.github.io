In the December 30, 2003 issue of PC Magazine, they [review several blogging tools](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1400319,00.asp) (congratulations to Six Apart for the Editor's Choice!), and [talk about RSS and popular aggregators](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1401206,00.asp), including FeedDemon, SharpReader, and [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com). From the article:

> *RSS is even poised to change the business world. \[...\] According to Greg Reinacker, the founder of NewsGator, programmers at at least one software company are using his aggregator to notify one another whenever they make changes to their communal code base.*
