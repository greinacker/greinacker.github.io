We've published our first NewsGator [case study](http://www.newsgator.com/casestudies/triplepoint.aspx) - take a look! There's lots of info about how Triple Point is using RSS, weblogs, and NewsGator within their company. An excerpt:

NewsGator provides seamless access to this information, all while preserving the familiar user experience of Microsoft Outlook.*
