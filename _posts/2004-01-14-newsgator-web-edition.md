Uh oh, I'm letting down on the job...it's already Wednesday, and I have a lot more to tell you about. :-)

NewsGator Web Edition, part of the NewsGator Online Services suite, is a web-based content aggregator which runs in a web browser.

Now there are plenty of other web-based aggregators out there...why do we need another one? A couple of reasons.

First, it works with the NGOS synchronization system ([more info](/gregr/weblog/2004/01/12/newsgator-synchronization/)). So you can read posts at home with Web Edition, and when you get to the office and download posts with NewsGator for Outlook, you won't have to read the same content. Unless you want to. And remember the sync system works with POP Edition and Mobile Edition too - more to come on that. Combine that with an online subscription management system, which even allows you to expose a subset of your subscriptions publicly as OPML, and we're onto something here.

Second, it's tightly integrated into the rest of the NGOS features - including custom search feeds and premium content...
