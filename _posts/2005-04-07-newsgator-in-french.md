NewsGator announced our [partnership with VNU](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=53) back in February...and the first fruits of this relationship went live today at <http://fr.newsgator.com>.  And it's not just translated...there is actually localized content within the system, including the feed taxonomy.

Si vous parlez français, jetez un coup d'oeil!  (heh - hopefully that says something like "if you speak french, take a look" - Google had to help me with that translation :-).

Watch for more localized versions coming over the upcoming weeks!
