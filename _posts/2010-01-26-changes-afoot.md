Over 7 years ago, I wrote a [blog post](/gregr/weblog/2003/01/04/news-aggregator/) that changed my life. It was just a screenshot of some prototype code, and a short 15 words. But it inspired the creation of [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com); about [six weeks later](/gregr/weblog/2003/02/23/newsgator-10-released/), I released NewsGator 1.0 and the journey had begun in earnest.

Now, 7 years later, NewsGator is much more than I ever imagined it would become. It has found its market in enterprise social computing software, and employs over 80 people in multiple countries. The team of folks at NewsGator are the best I have ever worked with; they are truly top-notch in every way. And in 2009, the company exceeded all of its revenue goals for every quarter and for the year as a whole, and counts many of the largest companies and governments in the world as its customers.

It is with this wind at my back that I have decided to move on from NewsGator, and find the next thing for me. What that next thing is I don't know; I may spend more time with my [fashion photography](http://www.gregrphoto.com), I may spend more time trading, I might do some consulting work, or I might involve myself with another startup. The future is wide open, as they say.

I'm tremendously proud of what we've accomplished, and happy that I had the chance to build this company from one guy in a spare bedroom, to what it is today. I will remain on NewsGator's board, and I look forward to whatever happens next!
