Since the [last time](/gregr/weblog/2003/05/27/ppir-national/) I wrote here about racing, there has been one more national, where I finished 4th again. Not good...

This weekend is another regional/national at Pueblo Motorsports park. This is the last national of the year in our division. I was out testing on Friday, and had nothing but problems - it was over 100 degrees, and my car was having serious vapor-lock problems. My crew got those ironed out by the end of the day, we think - cross your fingers!

Today was the regional. It was a bit cooler, probably in the 90's, and 17 cars in the field. Practice this morning was a little rough - I was 4th fastest, but about 1.5 seconds off the fastest time (yikes). This was on some crappy tires that I should probably have just thrown away. Anyway, I changed tires and made a small setup change for qualifying, and qualified on the pole by 0.2 seconds - a nice change, the way the weekend had started! The race went well - I led flag to flag, winning by probably 5 or 10 seconds.

So tomorrow is the national. I haven't finished better than 4th the last two national races, which has all but killed my chances to win the Rocky Mountain division. It's not over, though - if I do well tomorrow, I'm still in the running if I head out of division to pick up a few more points. I put on stickers (new tires, that is) for tomorrow, which are usually very fast at this track. John and Kim (the two drivers ahead of me in the national points for our division) also put on new sets...so we'll see how it goes!
