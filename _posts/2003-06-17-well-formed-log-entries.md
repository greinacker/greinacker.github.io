[Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1472.html) has started a [wiki](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/) to discuss what really makes up a weblog entry. He started it out with the following:

> *Authentic Voice of a Person. Reverse Chronological Order. On the web. These are essential characteristics of a online Journal or weblog.*

I think we should expand the scope of this just a bit, from "online journals or weblogs" to "syndicated content". There are a lot of interesting applications of syndicated content that have nothing to do with journals or weblogs, and these will arguably only grow in importance over time. For example, [event log monitoring](/gregr/weblog/2003/04/03/event-log-monitoring-with-rss/) - no voice, and not on the web...but uniquely useful.

In any case, if you're interested in syndication, definitely take a look.
