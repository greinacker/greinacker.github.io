Seems like every day we're flooded with new consumer-targeted cloud storage companies, promising easy backups and possibly tempting prices. And most of them have a free tier, offering a few GB to give us a taste. Some examples - [AVG LiveKive](http://www.avg.com/us-en/avg-livekive) (5GB free), [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) (2GB free), [Box.net](http://www.box.net/) (5GB free), [SugarSync](https://www.sugarsync.com/) (5GB free), [Windows Live SkyDrive](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive) (25GB free), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) (2GB free), [Memopal](http://www.memopal.com/en/) (3GB free), and even [Comcast](http://security.comcast.net/backup/details/) (2GB free) if you're a customer. There are plenty of others, but you get the idea.

If you add those up, you're at 49GB, which is a pretty reasonable amount of storage.

Seems like what we need is an app that looks something like [Jungle Disk](https://www.jungledisk.com/) to the user, that can present a single view, but aggregate storage from multiple places on the back end. So essentially you'd see a 49GB disk in the Finder or Explorer, but your stuff would be distributed among whatever storage you've configured.

Even better, a Super Jungle Disk-like app, which can still present a unified view to the user, but actually store your stuff on *multiple* back ends, so you effectively have a RAID-1 (e.g. mirrored) storage solution. So maybe your 500MB of photos get stored on both Box.net and Dropbox, but in any case are seamlessly managed by this front-end tool on your desk.

Sort of a cloud-storage [Drobo](http://www.drobo.com/). Now that would be cool.
