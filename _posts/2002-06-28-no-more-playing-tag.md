> *A Santa Monica elementary school principal recently banned tag, saying the game can only be played under the strict supervision of physical education teachers and not at all during the lunch hour recess. That's due to: one, the risk of injury; and two, a "self-esteem issue," because whoever is "it" could be considered a "victim." \[[ESPN.com](http://msn.espn.go.com/page2/s/caple/020626.html)\]*

Whew!  Thank heavens.  After 100 years of obviously damaged children, they've finally found the culprit.  On a similar note, a few weeks ago an elementary school suspended a kid for making a "gun" with his fingers (you know, "cowboys and indians" style).  Close call there, too... I mean, it's inevitable that after pointing your finger at someone on the playground, San Quentin is the next step.

Does anyone live in the real world anymore?  Hello?
