On Sunday, [Tom](http://www.ingeniumtr.com/tom/weblog) and I (and his Dad and Uncle) went out 4-wheeling near Argentine Pass, which is about an hour west of Denver. His uncle (a geologist) was quite excited about the whole thing and was glued to the topo map we had with us. He pointed out that the place we stopped for lunch, which was right about 13,000 feet elevation, was right on the continental divide.

Now, I've probably been to places on the divide a hundred times, but I never consciously realized it at the time.

I thought it was pretty cool. I dumped out some water where I was eating a sandwich, which might eventually (if you're very optimistic) make it into the Pacific ocean. Then I walked about 20 feet, and dumped out some more water that might someday see the Atlantic ocean. (I know, I know, it will never make it, but that's not the point!)
