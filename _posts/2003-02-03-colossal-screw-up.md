Sorry folks...I made a little mistake, and evidently didn't test a couple of bug fixes against each other. With certain feeds, the [old 0.8.4](/gregr/weblog/2003/02/03/newsgator-084/) (actually 0.8.4.1) would fail to retrieve, and the status window would just sit there and stare at you.

I built a new version, and the [download links](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/) have been updated. If you have installed 0.8.4 already (there's quite a few of you), check the version (Newsgator menu, About). If you are running 0.8.4.1, please go to the download site and install the updated one, which is 0.8.4.2.

Sorry about this...and thanks to Adam for pointing it out so quickly.
