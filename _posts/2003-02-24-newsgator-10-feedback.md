Some good comments on [NewsGator 1.0's](http://www.newsgator.com/) first day in the wild:

[Joe Friend](http://joe.weblog.or.id/2003/02/24.html#a632): "The best aggregator for Windows has shipped."

[Don Park](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/02/24.html#a282): "NewsGator 1.0 is released...Integration is really smooth without apparent seams."

[Sean Varley](http://www.cornerstonedesign-inc.com/weblog/2003/02/24.html#a24): "It's revolutionized the way I look at staying on top of my news, and I wouldn't want to do it any other way now."

[Brian Graf](http://www.codingwith.net/weblog/archive.aspx?postID=38): "NewsGator has fundamentally changed the way I keep up with the latest technology news. I endorse and recommend NewsGator unconditionally and without hesitation."

[Wes Haggard](http://dotnetweblogs.com/Whaggard/posts/2865.aspx): "This is a great product! It saves me lots of time."

[Steven Hatch](http://www.hatch.org/b2/archives/p/1095/more/1/c/1): "My favorite feature has always been its tight integration with Outlook."

Thanks for the kind words, guys!
