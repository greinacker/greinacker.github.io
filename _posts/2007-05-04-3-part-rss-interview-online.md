Way back in January, Rok Hrastnik over at The RSS Diary interviewed me for a book he was writing about RSS. I think we ended up chatting far longer than he expected :-), but in any case, he's published the interview as a podcast in 3 parts.

[Part 1](http://rssdiary.marketingstudies.net/content/the_newsgator_interview_how_are_vista_and_ie_changing_the_rss_landscap.php) - How are Vista and IE changing the RSS landscape?  
[Part 2](http://rssdiary.marketingstudies.net/content/the_newsgator_interview_rss_for_online_media_and_branded_rss_readers.php) - RSS for online media and branded readers  
[Part 3](http://rssdiary.marketingstudies.net/content/the_newsgator_interview_rss_in_the_enterprise_manage_internal_informat.php) - RSS in the enterprise

It was a while ago, and I haven't listened to them all yet, so hopefully I didn't say anything silly that I've since forgotten about!

As an aside, I totally hate hearing my phone voice when it's played back to me. I mean, do I really sound like that?!? Apparently so - lol. :-)
