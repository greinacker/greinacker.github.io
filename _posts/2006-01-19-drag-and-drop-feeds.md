A week or so ago, we loaded a cool new feature in NewsGator Online...and I wanted to let you know about it in case you haven't had a chance to look at it.

NewsGator Online provides a hierarchical folder stucture for you to organize your feeds, and it provides a "[organize folders](http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/subscriber/WebFolderMaint.aspxhttp://www.newsgator.com/ngs/subscriber/WebFolderMaint.aspx)" function so you can arrange them how you wish.  This worked, and we actually had a lot of customers praise this "organize folders" page versus what some other tools are doing.

But now we've gone one better.  The way I figure it, if you just want to move a couple of feeds around, you don't want to have to go to a whole other page...you just want to drag them around.  So now you can!  Take a look:

This shows me dragging a feed into the "NG blogs" folder.  Nothing to learn, nothing to think about...just drag it in there.  Unsubscribe, rename, and more are in the right-click menu on each feed/folder:

So anyway, take a look, and let us know what you think...we have a lot more coming for you soon!  And NewsGator Outlook edition, FeedDemon, and NetNewsWire are all nearing new releases...and after using all of them over the last few weeks, I can tell you that the synchronization and usability story is awesome.  More to come!
