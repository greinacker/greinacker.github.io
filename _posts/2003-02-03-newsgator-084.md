Well, there wasn't going to be another release before 0.9, but there were enough changes piling up that I wanted to get them out for people to use. So, you can now download v0.8.4 from the [NewsGator site](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/).

Users who are using the public 0.7 or 0.8 builds can just install 0.8.4 over them. If you are using a private build that you obtained directly from me, you need to uninstall it before installing this new version.

Changes:

- NewsPage recent posts now link to the specific message instead of the entire folder
- NewsPage will now show posts in the base news folder
- Added refresh button to NewsPage
- Feeds now alphabetized when retrieving
- Subscription URL's now displayed in edit dialog
- Added a "default location for new subscriptions", which is also used by context menu
- Visual indication when articles are read from the NewsPage
- NewsPage performance improvement for those with lots of read messages in news folders. Performance when all messages are unread is comparable to previous version.
- Allow multi-select on feeds when editing folder names
- Separated online/offline settings with check news interval
- Fixed some NewsPage problems experienced by a few users
- Fixed problem where if NG was launched other than at startup time (such as selecting the Add-in from tools/options), it would not properly initialize, and could sometimes crash
- Fixed problem when there were no feeds in the list
- Fixed problem where NG would not retrieve news again after encountering a RSS feed without a title
- Double click on subscription list now opens subscription for editing
- Progress dialog now has minimum size
- Minor adjustments to improve GUI interaction when retrieving many new feeds at once
