I usually like reading ReadWriteWeb, but I think this [article](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/apples-brilliant-boondoggle-macbook-pro-retina-display.php) this morning is just link bait (which obviously worked, because I'm linking to it):

> Buying a MacBook Pro with Retina means shelling out at least \$2,199 for a notebook with a 15.4-inch, 2880x1800 display. Top-end models approach \$3,500!
>
> By comparison, the cheapest 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at \$1,799, with half the resolution and a different but roughly comparable set of features and specifications. (The Retina version is smaller and lighter but lacks a DVD drive, and uses expensive Flash storage instead of a slower conventional hard drive.)

Anyone who has used an SSD knows there's nothing "roughly comparable" between the these two computers' configurations. But we can help them with the math.

Let's take the [cheapest 15-inch at \$1799](http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD103LL/A?). To get "roughly comparable", we'll need to upgrade the RAM to 8GB (\$100), and upgrade to the same 256GB SSD (\$500), for a total of \$2399. You could add another \$100 to upgrade to the 1680x1050 hi-res screen, but let's assume you don't want that.

To be fair, that machine will have a DVD drive and an ethernet port. So, let's add those to the [base retina MacBook Pro](http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MC975LL/A?). Base model is \$2199, add the USB SuperDrive (\$79), and add the Thunderbolt ethernet adapter (\$29), for a total of \$2307.

So the retina MBP is actually cheaper - AND it comes with 1GB of video RAM, vs. 512MB in the classic MBP.

Is the retina MBP expensive for a laptop? Yes. But none of the 15-inch MacBook Pros are cheap. The new model with the retina display is actually quite aggressively priced, IMHO, as compared with the prior models.
