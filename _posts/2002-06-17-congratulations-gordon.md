> [*It's a girl*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/2002/06/16.html#a74)*. Karyn gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Elaina Margaret Weakliem today (6/16) at 6:28 AM.  Mother and baby are doing fine.  Elaina is 5 lb. 13 oz., 19" long, and has a full head of hair and dark eyes.  She's been pretty sleepy today so we've been enjoying the quiet.  I'm very happy with my father's day present :-)
