More talk about secure RSS:

> "*I wish someone would solve the Secure RSS feature so we could apply some kinid of ACL to our subcriptions.  I'd love to be able to subscribe to each member of our company and get their RSS feeds from anywhere I want - NOT just inside the firewall*." --[Pete's Blog](http://weblogs.e-xact.com/0000003/2003/06/17.html) (Peter Fahlman) \[via [Into the MyST](http://myst-technology.com/mysmartchannels/public/item/13011)\]

Already done...with Enterprise weblogging systems like [MyST's](http://myst-technology.com/) [mySmartChannels](http://myst-technology.com/mysmartchannels/public/item/7451), and authentication aware aggregators like [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com), this is possible today.
