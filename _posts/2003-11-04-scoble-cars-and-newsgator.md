I read this post from Scoble:

> At the PDC there was this \$700,000 Mercedes taunting me. It was saying "go ahead, take a picture!" [So I did](http://www.pbase.com/scobleizer/inbox). Only one exists in the US right now. \$450,000 list price, but I met a dealer there who had already sold two of them for \$700,000 each (delivery starts next spring). \$50,000 deposit required. \[[The Scobleizer Weblog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/11/03.html#a5261)\]

Some great pictures of a super-nice car.  But the coolest part is hidden in one of the pictures - he's wearing a [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) shirt!

So I think what we can take away from this is, *people who like the Mercedes SLR will like NewsGator*. That logic follows, right? :-)
