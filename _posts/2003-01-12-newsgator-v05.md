Well, it figures...as soon as I drop v0.4 to the web, I get the problem fixed that was nagging at me. This was the problem where the "NewsGatorView" view in Outlook would not be correctly created much of the time, and often would not be correctly applied to news folders. All taken care of now. Note that views are only created when running Outlook 2002.

I was probably the only one who knew about, or even noticed, this problem...but it drove me crazy. :-)

Release 0.5 is now available for [download](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/). If you're upgrading from v0.4, read the release notes on the download site for details on what you should do to get the view working correctly.
