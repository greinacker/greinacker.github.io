From the [Arizona Republic](http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0122wvTrack22.html):

> *The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors ordered the closure of a controversial West Valley racetrack Wednesday...when it opened for business last spring with a Sports Car Club of America racing event, residents immediately began complaining about the noise of revving engines on the 2-mile course just south of Luke Air Force Base.*

A sad day. I've raced there - and it's an awesome track.

I just don't get it about the noise. Sure, a race track isn't a quiet place. But it is literally right next to an air force base. When we were there, we literally had to cover our ears sometimes as the jets would fly a few hundred feet overhead. Now THAT is noise, and a whole lot louder than the track was.
