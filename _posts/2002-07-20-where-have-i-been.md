Sorry for no posts over the last week, with absolutely no notice.  I've been out of town at a new client's office, and for some reason (despite setting everything up), I couldn't access Radio remotely.  Time to install on my laptop, I guess.

A few tidbits, which I'll probably write more about:

1\. I never realized just how cool Managed C++ is.  Well, I'm a convert now; after spending the week integrating some new .NET code with "legacy" C++ systems, I think managed C++ is the coolest thing going.  Don't panic, I still use C# where possible...but you can't do *everything* there.

2\. Wireless (802.11b) is seriously cool too!  I just installed an access point in my house, and I'm starting to wonder how I got along without it.  Now if only [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com) would install access points, I'd be the happiest camper ever.

3\. Dell's new [Latitude C640](http://www.dell.com/us/en/bsd/products/model_latit_latit_c640.htm) is very cool too!  This was delivered while I was out of town; a nice upgrade from my previous 8.5 pound 300 MHz portable.  My shoulder is going to thank me, I just know it...
