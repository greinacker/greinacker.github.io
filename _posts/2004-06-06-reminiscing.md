I was just flipping through some old posts here on my blog. It's been fun - a lot of it really takes me back to what was going on at the time. Like an online diary. I know, I know, people have been reflecting on this for ages, but I finally have posts that are old enough it's fun to go back and read them :-).

I'm going to try to start writing some more here, as soon as things calm down a little. Some of my favorite posts here have been about non-work-related stuff...so hopefully I can squeeze some more of that in too.

Some of my favorites -

[Semiconductor physics](/gregr/weblog/2002/06/05/who-says-semiconductor-physics-cant-be-fun/) - to those who know me well, you know this has to be a favorite. :-)

[Most eligible bachelorettes](/gregr/weblog/2002/08/30/most-eligible-bachelorettes/) - darn it, neither Sandra nor Britney called.

Valvoline runoffs ([1](/gregr/weblog/2002/09/17/runoffs-report-tuesday/), [2](/gregr/weblog/2002/09/17/runoffs-update/), [3](/gregr/weblog/2002/09/18/runoffs-wednesday/), [4](/gregr/weblog/2002/09/19/runoffs-final-qualifying-complete/), [5](/gregr/weblog/2002/09/19/runoffs-final-qualifying-complete/)) - tidbits from one of the highlights of my racing career thus far, the 2002 SCCA national championship.

[First race at Arizona Motorsports Park](/gregr/weblog/2003/03/10/last-weekend-at-arizona-motorsports-park/) - I'm glad I wrote about this...since as it turns out, this was the last race there I would get to go to before the track closed.

Driving ([1](/gregr/weblog/2003/04/17/front-and-rear-wheel-drive/), [2](/gregr/weblog/2003/05/31/revisiting-understeer/)) - musings on understeer/oversteer, and front/rear wheel drive. Some of the most fun I've had writing on my weblog...
