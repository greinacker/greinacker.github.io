There has been much written about the new [MacBook Pro with Retina display](http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MC975LL-15-4-Inch-Display/dp/B007471PZQ). I've had one for about a week; I'm not going to write a review, as I'm not sure how anyone could compete with [this review](http://www.anandtech.com/show/6023/the-nextgen-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review/)...but rather I'll just mention a few things I've noticed in using it for my work.

First, the retina display is quite striking when you use it with applications that have been updated with retina graphics. Most websites that have not updated their graphics don't look good at all, as I said earlier:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your web site looks like shit on the MBP Retina display (for nearly all instances of &quot;you&quot;).</p>&mdash; Greg Reinacker (@gregr) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregr/status/215150923918491648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2012</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The "blurry" effect is actually more noticeable on the MacBook Pro than it is on the iPad. So for the many, many folks I've heard saying "my site looks ok on the iPad, so I'm not going to worry about it" - my recommendation is take a look at it on the MacBook Pro, and make sure you're comfortable with how it looks. Hint: it probably looks worse than you think.

There are two things that I've found a little painful at the moment when using the new MacBook Pro, as [Joshua Johnson](http://designshack.net/articles/graphics/designing-on-a-retina-screen-my-thoughts-on-the-retina-macbook-pro/) also noticed.

First, trying to edit 1x artwork on the retina screen is definitely a challenge. At the moment, you just can't really tell how it's going to look on a non-retina screen. Maybe a future update to Photoshop CS6 or Pixelmator or some other app will fix this; we'll have to see.

And second, taking a screenshot on the retina MBP results in an image that's twice the size you expect; for example, if you're running at the "ideal" 1440x900 effective resolution, screen shots will be at 2880x1800. That's great if you need a 2x screenshot to display on a retina display...but if you need a screenshot to display on a 1x display, you don't have great options. You can downsize it in Photoshop or other editor, but you lose quality.

My solution to both of these problems has been to connect a regular non-retina screen for those tasks. This also has the advantage of letting me see quickly how things are looking on both retina and non-retina screens side by side, at the cost of being tethered to my desk...

All in all, the machine is beautiful, the screen is stunning when viewing high resolution content, and the machine is quite fast as compared to my other machines. I think the issues I mentioned above will probably (hopefully!) work themselves out as the software catches up with the display.
