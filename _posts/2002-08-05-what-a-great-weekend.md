I was out racing this weekend, and [won my first national race](http://www.laruemotorsports.com/News.aspx#16).  And not just one...I won TWO of them!  Talk about the best racing weekend ever.  I had pretty much ruled it out, but now I'm thinking again about going to the [national championship](http://www.laruemotorsports.com/Racing_Series.aspx) (the [Valvoline Runoffs](http://www.scca.org/amateur/club_racing/runoffs/index.html)).
