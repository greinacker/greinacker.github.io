I picked one of these up yesterday...after calling AT&T a few times (I'm an existing customer), I got the impression that it would be a week or so before I had it in my hands. So I called the local Best Buy, and they had a whole box of them - so about a half hour after that, I had one in my hands!

I have to say, this is a pretty cool device. In fact, my only complaint so far is that certain mMode functions (like the location services) don't work...or, more specifically, they don't show up on the mMode menu. If you type in the secret URLs, some of them will work, but some of them show errors. I would hope AT&T will get these things worked out soon.

Ok, two more complaints...it runs SmartPhone 2002 (instead of 2003, so only one email box), and no camera. But hey, we can't have everything all at once! ;-)

Great form factor, though - my first impression is that I think Motorola did a great job with this phone.
