Wow...what a day. I'm racing this weekend at Pikes Peak International Raceway; there are regionals on Saturday and Sunday, and a national on Monday. In today's regional, I qualified 2nd, 0.6 seconds off the pole (which is a lot - I was a bit disappointed). What a race, though - definitely the best race I've had in a long time. Kim (another guy in the CO region) and I pulled away from the pack, were pretty much nose-to-tail the entire race, passed each other probably 4 or 5 times each, and spent a lot of time side by side. At the end, he just got me - by about 3 feet (no exaggeration!), 0.05 seconds. So close!

On the bright side, though, I now hold the track record at PPIR for our class of car. Kim's fastest  
lap today was 0.002 seconds slower than mine. :-) We'll see if my first track record holds through the weekend!
