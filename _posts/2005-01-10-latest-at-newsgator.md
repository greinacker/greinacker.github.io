A couple of quick things to mention.

First, we're now publishing our subscriber statistics in our user-agent. That means when [NewsGator Online](http://www.newsgator.com) retrieves a feed, it sends information to the publisher about how many subscribers there are to that particular feed. There have been quite a few folks publishing their readership statistics recently, and we're trying to help out where we can.

And second, NewsGator and DivX [announced](http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/050105/55412_1.html) at CES that NewsGator would be providing content to their supported consumer electronics devices through their DivX Connected program. This is a really cool development. We've had [NewsGator Media Center edition](http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/Ad_MediaCenter.aspx) for quite some time now, and it's an awesome user experience for users with [Windows XP Media Center edition](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx) or [Snapstream Beyond Media](http://www.snapstream.com/Products/firefly/firefly_spotlight.asp). This DivX announcement takes that experience further, so you'll be able to buy a DVD player that can display and interact with content from NewsGator.
