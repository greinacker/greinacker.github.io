Well, qualifying is now complete (final grid is [here](http://www.scca.org/amateur/club_racing/runoffs/02results/srf-grid.html)).  I ran faster today and moved ahead of one of the guys previously ahead of me, but someone else ran a hundredth faster than me and moved up.  So all in all, I'm still qualified 5th.  Inside of row 3.  Not too bad for the national championship, I figure!

My original goal for the week was to qualify in the top half (of 29 cars), and to finish in the top 10.  Well, qualifying has certainly gone better than expected...hopefully the race will too!  I've revised my goal, but I don't want to jinx anything by writing it down.  :-)
