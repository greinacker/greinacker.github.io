Last time, we looked at [how clippings work](/gregr/weblog/2008/07/09/nges-in-60-seconds-clippings/) in NewsGator Enterprise Server.  At the end of the video, I mentioned that there are other ways to share clippings with other folks...I was referring to a feature called group clippings.

Group clippings are basically clippings that are shared among all the members of a group.  That group might be an Active Directory (or LDAP) group, or it might be an ad-hoc group defined in NGES.  The clippings for that group are, by default, private to that group - so you can have a confidential conversation among the members.

And as always, you can try all this out for yourself by downloading the [free 20-user version](http://www.newsgator.com/Business/EnterpriseServer/Default.aspx) of NewsGator Enterprise Server.
