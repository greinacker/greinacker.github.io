A [recent post](http://www.javageek.org/archives/001044.html) on javageek.org says that Reinacker & Associates, Inc. and NewsGator Technologies are giving customer email addresses to spammers.

Just to clear things up, this is absolutely NOT TRUE. We don't share ANY private customer information with any third party. For that matter, we almost never even use these email addresses ourselves, except to reply to specific inquiries; all customer communication is done via RSS.

I'm not sure what could have happened in this particular case, but we will investigate it as soon as I can get in touch with the author of the above post.

**UPDATE:** they posted a retraction [here](http://www.javageek.org/archives/001049.html). It turns out the javageek.org guy posted a comment here on my weblog with his email address, which was published with the post, and obviously scraped off the page by spammers.
