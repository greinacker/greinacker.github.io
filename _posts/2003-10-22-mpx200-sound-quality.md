Hmm...this phone comes with both a mono headset and a stereo headset. Which teased me into thinking that the phone, plus a large SD card, would make an awesome MP3 player. However, using the stereo headset, the sound quality leaves something to be desired. There's pretty much no bass response whatsoever.

So now I'm wondering if it's the phone, or the headset. It's got a pretty small plug (2mm maybe?), and of course my normal headphones don't have this side of plug.

Any ideas? Or has anyone else tried this, and could report what they found?
