I've been meaning to mention a couple of folks here for a while now.

First, I'd like to thank Didier from [nundroo](http://www.nundroo.com), who designed our [new logo](http://www.newsgator.com/images/nglogo_md.gif) and is working on some upcoming ad graphics. Great job, Didier!

And second, thanks for the folks at [Hunny Software](http://www.hunnysoft.com/), whose excellent [MIME.NET](http://www.hunnysoft.com/nmime/index.html) package was instrumental in getting our NNTP support into NewsGator quickly enough for the 1.3 release.
