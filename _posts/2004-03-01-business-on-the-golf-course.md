Most folks will agree...a lot of business gets done on the golf course. Balls are lost, but relationships are formed and deals are made.

Jeff Sandquist [recently posted](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/PermaLink,guid,00edafcf-b233-41f6-95a5-8ec53367dd95.aspx) about getting folks together to play Links 2004 on XBOX Live, and I thought, "fun idea". It wasn't until I talked with Jeff later that I realized the power behind such a simple idea. Not only are you playing the game, but you're chatting with the players in your group. A friendly game of golf, between folks from Microsoft and ISV's. Friendly banter. Competition on the course. Relationships are made, which are the foundation of a successful business.

I wish I had thought of it. Count me in.
