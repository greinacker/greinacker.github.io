...also known as [Blogging for Associations, Non-profits & Content-driven Web Sites](http://www.wordbizstore.com/blogging_seminar04.html), is happening on June 30 in Washington, D.C. [Debbie Weil](http://www.debbieweil.com/), a wizard of online publishing and marketing, has lined up [Komra Moriko](http://www.wordbizstore.com/blogging_seminar04.html#komra) to speak. Debbie says there are still a few spots left as of today.

NewsGator Technologies is pleased to sponsor the seminar, and is giving away a 6-month subscription to [NewsGator Online Services](http://services.newsgator.com) (a \$65.70 value) to all attendees.

To quote Debbie - "Blogging for business isn't about being cool..."  Well said!
