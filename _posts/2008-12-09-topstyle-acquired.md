I'm pleased to announce that Stefan van As has acquired [TopStyle](http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/topstyle/default.aspx), and is already planning a major release for Q1 2009.

As many of you know, NewsGator had TopStyle as a result of the acquisition of Bradbury Software a few years back. Since then, its development has been somewhat slow; the company's focus was on RSS and social software, and TopStyle, while a very successful product, didn't really fit directly into that mix.

So that's why I'm so excited that Stefan will be taking this over, and putting some serious effort into TopStyle. To all the customers that stuck with the product, a big thank you! And now, sometime in the next few months, you'll have a new release to look forward to...and I know that Stefan is eager to hear your feedback and feature requests, so don't be shy. :-)
