**Announcing Groove Experiments shared space and work**

[Greg Reinacker](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/) and [Sam Gentile](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/) would like to <u>announce</u> our creation of "Groove Experiments". We have been working and Groovin to flesh out some ideas.This dynamic shared [Groove](http://www.groove.net/) space has three main purposes:

1.   [Groove](http://www.groove.net/) and Blogs. There are certain synergies between [Groove](http://www.groove.net/) spaces and weblogs. Let's enumerate and expand a bit on the possibilities. In particular, one great synergy, especially in the Web Services and .NET communities, is the initial posting of some technical idea or topic on a Blog and then wanting to get into a more "direct" and detailed discussion or interaction about that. Groove is excellent for that immediate phase of fleshing out and discussing the idea(s). So the first main area and disussion is around providing the ability to have detailed disucssions about blog topics and explore the synergy further.
2.  Groove and Web Services - We believe that there are some great ideas to be explored in this area. Lets get them on the table. Maybe have a groovespace aggregator that lets you see new entries for multiple groove spaces, so you can keep up with all the the activity for topics on your blog. There are also plenty of areas of discussion on Web Services in general and where they should go.
3.  Groove Platform Applications - We believe that the value of Groove is not in the existing tools but in the underlying Platform and the decentralized peer-to-peer communications mechanism that can create some really interesting applications. Lets explore.

This is something Sam and I have been working on. I want to emphasize that neither of us is an employee of [Groove Networks](http://www.groove.net/) and that this shared space is not speaking for Groove or sanctioned by Groove. We believe that there are fine areas of interesting research to be done here. If you are interested in particpating, please email [Greg](mailto:%20gregr@rassoc.com) or [Sam](mailto:%20ManagedCode@attbi.com) to be sent an invitation. Ideally, we would like to keep it to under 12 particpants.
