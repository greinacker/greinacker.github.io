**Web Services DevCon**

> *I'm currently doing final preparations for my leave to the* [*biggest .NET weblogger gathering*](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/conference)*.  \[*[*Ingo Rammer's DotNetCentric*](http://www.dotnetremoting.cc/DotNetCentric/)*\]*

This is so true...talk about a critical mass of webloggers.  :-)  I just yesterday managed to adjust my schedule a bit to make it to this, and I think it's going to be a great time!  I'm looking forward to meeting a lot of you fellow webloggers.
