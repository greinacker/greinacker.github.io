Ok, every now and then I [search for 'Greg'](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Greg) in Google, just to see where I am.  Today I'm up to \#40, behind sites like [Dharma & Greg](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/dharmaandgreg/) and [Greg the Bunny](http://www.fox.com/greg/).  :-)  But the one that caught my eye was \#43, which was for [Greg Ray](http://www.gregray.com/).  He is an IRL driver (a pretty famous one), and in his [bio](http://www.gregray.com/gregsbio.asp) it says:

> ***First racing experience**  
> Drove a spec racer at SCCA driver's school, Denver, Colorado in September 1991. *

He raced with [LaRue Motorsports](http://www.laruemotorsports.com), which is the company I currently race with.  The LaRue's have two daughters, named Nikki (now 21) and Michelle (16), who work on the cars along with their parents.  They have a [picture](http://www.laruemotorsports.com/ShowPhoto.aspx?url=photos\GregRay.jpg) on their site of Nikki and Michelle with Greg Ray, way back when he was racing the Spec Racer Fords.  Very cool!  Small world.  :-)
