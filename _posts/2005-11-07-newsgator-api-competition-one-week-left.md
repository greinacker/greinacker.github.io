There's [one week left](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=72) to enter the NewsGator [API developer competition](http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/api/contest/default.aspx), and win a Dell Latitude, Apple Powerbook, or iPod Nano. A couple of the [categories](/gregr/weblog/2005/09/13/write-cool-code-win-a-laptop/) have a small number of entries so far, so there's an excellent chance of winning if you enter! You have until November 11 at midnight to enter your application...
