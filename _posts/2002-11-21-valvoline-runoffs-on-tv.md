If anyone is interested, the [Valvoline Runoffs](http://www.scca.org/amateur/club_racing/runoffs/) are being televised on the [Speed Channel](http://www.speedtv.com/).  The Spec Racer Ford race (that's mine) will be this Sunday morning, 11/24, at 12pm eastern / 9am pacific.  I was in car \#7, white and blue.  Should be fun to watch!
