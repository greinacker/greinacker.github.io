...and the future is really blazin' fast connections.

We used to have 4 T1's ganged together somehow in our office, giving us around 6 Mb/sec. Shared by 75 people, and responsible for not only internet but also telephone traffic, you can imagine it wasn't exactly fast.

At home I have a Comcast cable modem, and I get something like 8 Mb/sec, which until today I thought was pretty fast.

But this morning, when I got to the office, our IT folks had completed our office network cutover to a 100 Mb/sec fiber connection to the internet...and oh. my. gosh. I downloaded a 20MB file just for fun, and it was done by the time I could look at my watch to find the second hand and figure out how long it took. Download progress meters aren't any fun any more, as they go from 0 to 100% with hardly any stops in between...

I was chatting with one of said IT guys about it, as they've been using the new connection for a few days before they cut over the whole office...he said it takes something like 15 or 20 minutes to download a DVD from MSDN subscriber downloads, and he said "it's almost easier than looking through the case to find the physical DVD." Lol!
