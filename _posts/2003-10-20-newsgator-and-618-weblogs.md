Over the weekend, [Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/10/18.html#a5107) talked about how he uses [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) to read 618 weblogs and feeds. Wow! If he tries out the search folders with NewsGator in Outlook 2003 (as mentioned [here](/gregr/weblog/2003/04/22/newsgator-and-outlook-2003/)), he'll probably like it even better.

After reading Scoble's post, [Craig Burton](http://www.craigburton.com/) decided to give NewsGator a try. Craig [says](http://www.craigburton.com/discuss/msgReader$321):

> *I downloaded Newsgator and played with it for a while. I really like it. So far I only have about 70 feeds to watch.*
>
> *I then worked on Amphetadesk for a while. It took me longer to set up 25 feeds in Amphetadesk than it did the 70 in Newsgator.*

That's what I like to hear! :-)
