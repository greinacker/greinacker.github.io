The original code I had [posted](/gregr/weblog/2003/06/25/rss-and-sourcesafe/) to generate RSS feeds from a VSS database has expired; I just put up a new version that will work through the end of October, and fixed a couple of bugs at the same time.

This is an awesome tool (IMHO) - check it out! :-)

Refer to the [original post](/gregr/weblog/2003/06/25/rss-and-sourcesafe/) for instructions.
