This is so cool. Since the first release of NewsGator for Outlook, you've been able to right-click on a feed link in Internet Explorer and select "Subscribe in NewsGator".

Now you can do [the same thing](http://stuandgravy.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/newsgator_right.html) in Firefox - many thanks to Stuart Hamilton for putting this together!
