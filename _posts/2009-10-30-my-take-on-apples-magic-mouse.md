Never one to let new toys sit on store shelves too long, I picked up a [Magic Mouse](http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/) as soon as they were available in the local Apple stores. I was one of those rare folks who actually liked the [mouse-formerly-known-as Mighty Mouse](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB112LL/B), so thought I'd write about it from that perspective.

First, I love the scrolling action when you slide your finger on the mouse. \_Love\_ it. I also find that I really like the momentum scrolling option, which, like the iPhone, dampens the scrolling effect when you lift your finger rather than stopping abruptly. I thought I'd hate the momentum (makes sense on the iPhone, but on a computer?!?), but it didn't take long to get used to it, and then like it, and then actually be bummed when it didn't work well in an app. The only app I've found so far that it doesn't seem to work well in is [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/); I think it is actually working, but it's so highly damped that you can't really tell. \[I saw a [tweet](http://twitter.com/atebits/status/5295050808) from Loren saying he's waiting for his mouse to come in so he can work on it.\]

If you want to stop the scrolling abruptly, like other mice, just don't pick up your finger when you're done scrolling...and it will stop in its tracks. Perfect.

The only scroll-related gotcha I've found is when you're in an app where you can scroll down one line at a time (the example for me is the ThinkOrSwim trading app, looking at level 2 quotes, trying to scroll down one line at a time)...with the mighty mouse, it was easier to scroll down just one line, or three lines, or whatever you wanted. With the magic mouse, it's still possible, but takes some finesse, which I haven't mastered yet.

The other thing I really like is the fact that you can use the whole surface of the mouse for scrolling. Sometimes I'll be reading a long web page, and take my hand off the mouse. Now when I want to scroll down a bit, I don't have to position my finger right on the scroll ball, but in fact can just stick a finger anywhere on the mouse and scroll around.

Right-clicking on the magic mouse works exactly like it did on the mighty mouse, which works well for me. The two-finger swipes to go back and forward in a browser do work...but I haven't trained myself to do it yet. It's a touch awkward now, IMHO, but who knows, maybe I'll grow to like it.

I do miss the extra buttons on the mighty mouse, which I had assigned to dashboard and expose. My hope is that Apple maybe adds some options in the mouse preferences to re-map the two-finger swipe to other functions, so we can customize the behavior to our liking. Or perhaps there are other gestures the mouse can recognize that just aren't implemented in the driver yet. I'm not holding my breath, though. :-)

All in all, I like it a lot. I'll probably end up buying another one for my other computer now. And, in case you want one, here are make-me-rich Amazon links for the [Magic Mouse](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TLTGM6?ie=UTF8&tag=gregreinphotb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002TLTGM6) and the [wired mouse](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TLTH7K?ie=UTF8&tag=gregreinphotb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002TLTH7K)!
