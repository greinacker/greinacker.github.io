By now, you've undoubtedly heard about [Kindle for iPhone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Ffeature.html%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Damb%255Flink%255F83811991%255F2%26docId%3D1000301301&tag=gregreinphotb-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957). It's pretty cool, actually...pretty bare bones functionality, but it tries its best to [get out of the way](/gregr/weblog/2009/03/03/my-thoughts-on-the-kindle-2/) and let you read.

Yesterday evening, I was meeting someone at Starbucks, and she was running about 15 minutes late. I was fiddling with my iPhone, and remembered that I had the new Kindle app on there, and had already downloaded the book I'm currently reading on the "big" [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&tag=gregreinphotb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00154JDAI).

I opened the app, which was already on the page I'm currently on. I read for a bit, and actually finished a whole chapter before my friend arrived. When I was done, I closed the app, and it did its magic sync back to the Amazon cloud with the page I had made it to.

When I got home later, I turned on my Kindle just to see what would happen. I clicked into the book from the home screen, and a message popped up saying something like "you've read up to location 2500 on gregr's iPhone; would you like to move to that location now?" (those weren't the exact words, but pretty close). I clicked yes, and that's all there was to it - I was exactly at the point I left off earlier.

Pretty cool - better than I expected. I can totally imagine reading a bit of my book when waiting for an appointment, standing in a long line, or something like that.

So the good and the bad?

Good:

\- Pretty much does exactly what you'd hope. You can read your book, and the rest of the GUI disappears.

\- It's free!

Bad:

\- While the "swipe" is intuitive to change pages, it's not very much fun after you've done it 50 times in a row. They should make it so if you tap somewhere, it skips to the next page.

All in all - it's not the same as a Kindle, or similar to a book for that matter. The screen is small, and it's backlit and less comfortable to read, at least for me. I wouldn't want to read a whole book on this screen myself - but for short breaks, it works quite well. And somehow, I feel like my e-books are worth more now that I can read them in multiple places. :-)
