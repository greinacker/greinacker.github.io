Well, this flies in the face of what [Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html) has been saying, but I have added a [RSS feed](http://www.newsgator.com/forumrss.aspx) for the [NewsGator forums](http://www.newsgator.com/forum). The feed contains the 20 most recent posts.

I'm not sure this would work well for extremely high-traffic forums, but for the current volume in the NewsGator forums, I think it works pretty well.  At very least it's handy for me, so I can easily be notified when there's a new post there.

The forums are using the [ASP.NET forums](http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=41) code; if anyone else is using this code, and wants to generate a RSS feed from them, [let me know](/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx) and I'll be happy to send you the code.
