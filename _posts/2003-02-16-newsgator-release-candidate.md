If you are interested in testing a NewsGator release candidate, please [let me know](/gregr/weblog/contact.aspx). This will be a very limited release, and we will only be taking a limited number of requests.

When you respond, please include the following information:

- Operating System and SP
- .NET version and SP
- Outlook version
- Are you currently using NewsGator?
- Number of subscriptions in NewsGator

You will hear back from me within a couple of days if you are selected. Thanks!

**UPDATE: wow, what a response. We have enough people now; if you responded, you should be hearing back soon.**
