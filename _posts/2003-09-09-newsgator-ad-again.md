From [Matt Berther](http://www.mattberther.com/2003/09/000177.html):

> *I've typically been against a lot of advertising on websites, however, I have now put my first advertisement on* [mattberther.com](http://www.mattberther.com).*
>
> *The decision behind this was simple. The ad is for* [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com), which is a tool that I use on a daily basis, and one that I could not imagine being without.*

Thanks Matt! For those of you who don't know, Matt is the author is the excellent [MovablePoster](http://www.mattberther.com/movableposter/) plug-in for [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com), which allows you to post to your [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) or [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com) weblog.
