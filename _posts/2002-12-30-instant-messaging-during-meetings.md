Cory Doctorow posted [Chat as a side-channel for face-to-face meetings](http://boingboing.net/2002_12_01_archive.html#90102357). This got me thinking - I've used MSN Messenger many times during conference calls, to discuss things real-time with certain attendees but off-line from the call. It's proved especially useful when having a conference call with one of my clients, and one of their suppliers/customers. Kind of takes the place of the "lean over and whisper" thing, when you're not all in the same room.
