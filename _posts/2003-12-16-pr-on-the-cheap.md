Freelance writer [Ron Miller](http://byronmiller.typepad.com/byronmiller/2003/12/newsgator_featu.html) wrote an article featuring [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com) in his latest Home Base column in Network World Fusion, titled [PR on the Cheap](http://www.nwfusion.com/net.worker/columnists/2003/1215miller.html). From Ron's weblog:

> *I describe how small companies who can't afford to hire a PR firm or a clipping service, can use a news aggregator such as NewsGator to help monitor the Web and blogs for information about their company or markets.*

Great stuff!
