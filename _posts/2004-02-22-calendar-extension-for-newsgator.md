Wow, I just get done talking about some [cool extensions](/gregr/weblog/2004/02/18/newsgator-extensions/) for [NewsGator 2.0](http://www.newsgator.com), and another one pops up.

[John Bristowe](http://www.bristowe.com/blog/) and [Jeff Julian](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/) have built an [ESF](http://www.esfstandard.org/) extension for NewsGator. With this extension installed, if a feed publishes information about an event in a certain way, a new item will get added to Outlook's calendar with the event details.

John has a [sample feed and a screenshot](http://www.bristowe.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bc2ca8bf-b726-4131-a1d5-1da5ec334f0c) in Outlook on his weblog...check it out. This is really beginning to demonstrate the power of RSS extensions, when used with an extension-aware client. Nice job, guys!
