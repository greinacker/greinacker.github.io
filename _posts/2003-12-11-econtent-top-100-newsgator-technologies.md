[NewsGator Technologies](http://www.newsgator.com) has been listed in the EContent Magazine Top 100 list for 2003! From the magazine:

> *"Welcome to the third annual EContent 100 - our list of companies that matter most in the digital content industry."*

So far, this is only in the print magazine, not yet online...I'll add a link to this post when it hits their web site.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our staff, contractors, partners, and customers for making this possible. And if you think 2003 was good, wait until you see what we're going to ship in 2004. :-)
