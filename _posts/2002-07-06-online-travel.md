> *Somehow, I see a lot of complaints about Expedia \[...\]  This also makes me wonder that if the airlines get their wish and eventually customers purchase most of their tickets directly from the carrier, will they do any better?  \[*[*Gordon Weakliem's Radio Weblog*](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/)*\]*

I travel quite a bit, and I make 95% of my reservations on [United's web site](http://www.ual.com).  One advantage is web-only fares (which are only on their site); another is that if you call them, there is no middle man to worry about, like some of the [horror](http://boingboing.net/2002_05_01_archive.html#85130767) [stories](http://boingboing.net/2002_05_01_archive.html#85130767) I've read from Gordon's references.  I've always gotten good service from them.  Of course, my plan only works if you primarily fly on one airline...

By the way, I notice I've been somewhat off-topic for a few days (still not sure what my topic is, but I know this isn't it)...not to worry, some cool sample code and an article is ready to post, probably Monday or Tuesday.  A free mention to the first person to guess what the sample might be.  ;-)
