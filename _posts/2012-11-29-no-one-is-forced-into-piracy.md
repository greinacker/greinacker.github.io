[No one is "forced" into piracy](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/28/why-are-cable-companies-forcing-people-to-turn-to-piracy.html)

> \[...\] if piracy is actually wrong, it doesn't get less wrong simply because you can't have the product exactly when and where you want it at a price you wish to pay.

This. Just because you can't find the content you want in the form you'd like to have it, doesn't mean it's ok to steal it. \[via [Marco](http://www.marco.org/2012/11/29/forcing-people-into-piracy)\]
