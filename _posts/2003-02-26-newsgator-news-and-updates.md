If you have upgraded to NewsGator 1.0 from a previous version, then you probably aren't subscribed to the [NewsGator News and Updates feed](http://www.newsgator.com/news/rss.aspx) (new users get this subscription by default). If you're interested in the latest news about NewsGator, I recommend you subscribe!

NewsGator users, [right-click here](http://www.newsgator.com/news/rss.aspx) with IE to automatically subscribe. Not using IE? Go to NewsGator/Options, and add the subscription from there.
