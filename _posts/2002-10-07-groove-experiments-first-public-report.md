A dozen or so of us have been tossing around a lot of great ideas in the [Groove Experiments](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/10/02.html#a1234) shared space. One of our concerns, of course, is how to seemlessly share our findings publically with a wide public mechanism. Tonight, we decided to re-focus completly in a new direction, one direction. We felt that instead of continuing to be somewhat abstract that it would be better to take one of our ideas, discuss it, form requirements, and start writing code! We have decided to focus on a Groove to Weblog interface. We do realize that there have been two previous partial implementations that we will be looking at: [Tim Knipp's Blogger Tool](http://radio.weblogs.com/0107414/2002/09/29.html#a90) and the Agora Groovelog. One of the members is looking into those two. We realize that this kind of dump from me here now is not optimal. Ideally we would like to have things available in real-time as they happen publically. Maybe this Tool or Solution will go a long way toward that. \[reposted from [Sam Gentile's Radio Weblog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/)\]
