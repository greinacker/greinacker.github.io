Yet again, the code I posted to generate RSS feeds from Visual SourceSafe has expired...I've posted a new version that will work until February 28, 2004.

More info (and instructions) [here](/gregr/weblog/2003/06/25/rss-and-sourcesafe/) and [here](/gregr/weblog/2003/08/05/rss-and-sourcesafe-updated/).

UPDATED: expiration date extended through October 31, 2004 - download the updated version from the links below.
